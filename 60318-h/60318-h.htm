<p><span class="firstword">It</span> has long been the custom at the Royal Institution
of Great Britain to provide each Christmastide
a course of Lectures specially addressed to a juvenile
audience.</p>

<p>On two occasions, namely, in 1881 and in 1887,
the Managers entrusted this honorable duty to me.
The second course was in the main a repetition of
the first; and on my notes and recollections of both
the present little volume has been founded.</p>

<p>I am indebted to my friends Rev. <span class="smcap">Maxwell Close</span>,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Arthur Rambaut</span>, and Dr. <span class="smcap">John Todhunter</span>
for their kindness in reading the proofs.</p>

<h3>THE HEAT AND BRIGHTNESS OF THE SUN.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">We</span> can all feel that the sun is very hot, and we
know that it is very big and a long way off. Let us
first talk about the heat from the sun. On a cold day
it is pleasant to go into a room with a good fire, and
everybody knows that the nearer we go to the fire, the
more strongly we feel the heat. The boy who is at
the far end of the room may be shivering with cold,
while those close to the fire are as hot as they find to
be pleasant. If we could draw much nearer to the sun
than we actually are, we should find the heat greatly
increased. Indeed, if we went close enough, the temperature
would rise so much that we could not endure
it; we should be roasted. On the other hand, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
should certainly be frozen to death if we were transported
much further away from the sun than we are
now. We are able to live comfortably, because our
bodies are just arranged to suit the warmth which the
sun sends to that distance from it at which the earth
is actually placed.</p>

<p>Suppose you were able to endure any degree of heat,
and that you had some way of setting out on a voyage
to the sun. Take with you a wax candle, a leaden
bullet, a penny, a poker, and a flint. Soon after you
have started you find the warmth from the sun increasing,
and the candle begins to get soft and melt away.
Still, on you go, and you notice that the leaden bullet
gets hotter and hotter, until it becomes too hot to
touch, until at last the lead has melted, as the wax
had previously done. However, you are still a very
long way from the sun, and you have the penny, the
poker, and the flint remaining. As you approach closer
to the luminary the heat is ever increasing, and at last
you notice that the penny is beginning to get red-hot;
go still nearer, and it melts away, and follows the
example of the bullet and the candle. If you still
press onwards, you find that the iron poker, which was
red-hot when the penny melted, begins to get brighter
and brighter, till at last it is brilliantly white, and
becomes so dazzling that you can hardly bear to look
at it; then melting commences, and the poker is
changed into liquid like the penny, the lead, and the
wax. Yet a little nearer you may carry the flint,
which is now glowing with the same fervor which
fused the poker, but even the flint itself will have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
to yield at last and become, not merely a liquid like
water, but a vapor like steam.</p>

<p>You will ask, how do we learn all this? As nobody
could ever make such a journey, how can we feel certain
that the sun is so excessively hot? I know that what
I say is true for various reasons, but I will only mention
one, which is derived from an experiment with the
burning-glass, that most boys have often tried.</p>

  <img src="images/i_p004.jpg" width="332" height="499" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>—The Noonday Gun.</div></div>

<p>We may use one of those large lenses that are
intended for magnifying photographs. But almost any
kind of lens will do, except it be too flat, as those in
spectacles generally are. On a fine sunny day in summer,
you turn the burning-glass to the sun, and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
holding a piece of paper at the proper distance a bright
spot will be obtained (<a href="#ifig_1">Fig. 1</a>). At that spot there is
intense heat, by which a match can be lighted, gunpowder
exploded, or the paper itself kindled. The
broad lens collects together the rays from the sun that
fall upon it, and concentrates them in one spot, which
consequently becomes hot and bright. If we merely
used a flat piece of glass the sunbeams would go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
straight through; they would not be gathered together,
and they would not be strong enough to burn the paper.
The lens, you see, is not flat; its faces are curved, and
they thus acquire the power of bending in rays of light
or heat, so as to unite their effect on that one point
which we call the <em>focus</em>. When a great number of rays
are thus collected on the same spot, each of them contributes
a little warmth.</p>

<div id="ifig_3" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 17em;">
  <img src="images/i_p005.jpg" width="268" height="285" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>—A Tell-tale for the Sun.</div></div>

<p>Some ingenious person has turned this principle to
an odd use, by arranging a burning-glass over a cannon
in such a way that just when noon arrived the spot of
light should reach the touch-hole of the cannon and fire
it off. Thus the sun itself is made to announce the
middle of the day (<a href="#ifig_2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p>Another application of the burning-glass is to obtain
a record of the number of hours of sunshine in each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
day. You will understand the apparatus from <a href="#ifig_3">Fig. 3</a>;
the lens is here replaced by a glass globe, which acts
as a burning-glass. As the sun moves over the sky
the bright spot of light also moves, and therefore
burns its track on a sheet of paper marked with lines
corresponding to the hours. When the sun is hidden
by clouds the burning ceases, so by preserving each
day the piece of paper, we have an unerring tell-tale,
which shows us during what hours the sun was shining
brightly, and the hours during which he was hidden.
You see, the burning-glass is not merely a toy, it
can be made useful in helping us to learn something
about the weather.</p>

<p>Another experiment with the burning-glass will also
teach us something. Take a candle, and from its flame
you can get a bright point at the focus. It may fall
upon your hand, but you can hardly feel it, and you will
readily believe that the focus is not nearly so hot as the
candle. Even when a burning-glass is held in front of
a bright fire there is comparatively little heat in the
focus. By using a lens to condense the beams from an
electric lamp, Professor Tyndall has shown how to light a
piece of paper, and to produce many other effects. But,
nevertheless, the focus is not nearly so hot as the arc
between the two glowing carbons. You might move
your finger through the focus without much inconvenience,
but I would not recommend you to trust your
finger between the poles of the electric light itself. The
temperature obtained at the focus of a burning-glass
seems thus to be always less than that prevailing at the
source of heat itself. This principle will be equally true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
when we turn a burning-glass to the sun, and hence we
know that the sun must be hotter than any heat which
can be obtained by the biggest burning-glass on the
brightest of summer days. But burning-glasses a yard
wide have been made, and astonishing heat effects have
been produced. Steel has thus been melted by the sunbeams,
and so have other substances which even our
greatest furnaces cannot fuse. Therefore the sun must
have a higher temperature than that of molten steel;
higher, indeed, than any temperature we can produce
on the earth.</p>

<p>I have tried to prove to you that the sun is very
hot; but it would be well to see what arguments might
be used on the other side. Indeed, it is by considering
objections that we often learn. So I shall tell you of a
difficulty that was once raised when I was endeavoring
to explain the heat of the sun to an intelligent man.
“I am sure,” said my friend, “that you must be quite
wrong. You said that the nearer you got to the sun
the hotter it would be; but I know this to be a mistake.
When tourists go to Switzerland, they sometimes climb
very high mountains. But the top of a mountain, of
course, is nearer the sun than below; and so, if the sun
were really hot, the climber should have found it much
warmer on the top of the mountain than at its base.
But every one knows that there is abundant ice and
snow on lofty Alpine summits, while down below in the
valleys there may be at the same time excessively warm
weather. Does it not therefore seem that the nearer we
go to the sun the colder it is, and the further we are
from the sun the warmer it is?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
But my friend was quite wrong in his argument.
The coldness of the mountain tops depends upon something
which he had not taken into account. There
is something else besides the sun which helps to
make us so warm and comfortable. This other essential
thing is more or less deficient at great heights.
You know that we live by breathing air, and we find
air wherever we go, over land and sea, all round the
earth. Those who ascend in balloons are borne upwards
by the air, and thus we can show that air extends for
miles and miles over our heads, though it becomes
lighter and thinner the loftier the elevation.</p>

<p>We not only utilize the air for breathing, but it is
also of indispensable service to us in another way. It
acts as a blanket to keep the earth warm; indeed, we
ought rather to describe the air as a pile of blankets one
over the other. These air blankets enable the earth
to preserve the heat received from the sunbeams by
preventing it from escaping back again into space.
Thus warmth is maintained, and our globe is rendered
habitable. You see then, that for our comfort
we require not only the sun to give us the heat, but
also the set of blankets to keep it when we have got
it. If we threw off the blankets we should be uncomfortable,
though the sun were as bright as before. A
man who goes to the top of a mountain at mid-day does
approach the sun to some extent, and, so far as this
goes, he ought no doubt to feel warmer, but the gain
is far too small to be thought of. Even at the top of
Mont Blanc the increase in heat due to the approach
to the sun would be only one ten-millionth part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
whole. This would be utterly inappreciable; even a
thermometer would not be delicate enough to show it.
On the other hand, by ascending to the top of the
mountain, the climber has got above the lower regions
of the air; he has not, it is true, reached even halfway
to the upper surface—that is still very far over his
head—but the higher layers of the atmosphere are
so very thin that they form most indifferent blankets.
The Alpine climber on the top of the mountain has
thus thrown off the best portion of his blankets, and
receives a chill; while the gain of heat arising from
his closer approach to the sun is imperceptible. Perhaps
you will now be able to understand why eternal
snow rests on the summits of the great mountains.
They are chilled because they have not so many air
blankets as the snug valleys beneath.</p>

<p>The brightness of the sun is among the most wonderful
things in nature, and there are three points that I
ask you to remember, and then indeed you will agree
with Milton, that the sun is “with surpassing glory
crowned.” First think of the beauty and brilliancy of
a lovely day in June. Then remember that all this
flood of light comes from a single lamp at a most
tremendous distance; and thirdly, recollect that the
sun is not like a bull’s-eye lantern, concentrating all
his light <em>specially</em> for our benefit, but that he diffuses
it equally around, and that we do not get on this earth
the two-thousand-millionth part of what he gives out
so plenteously! When we think of the brightness of
day, of the distance from which the light has come,
though Nature has not adjusted any vast lenses to direct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
the light specially in our direction, we begin to comprehend
the sun’s true magnificence.</p>

<h3>FURTHER BENEFITS THAT WE RECEIVE FROM
THE SUN.</h3>

<p>I want to show you how great should be the extent
of our gratitude to the sun. Of course, on a bright
summer’s day, when we are revelling in the genial
warmth and enjoying the gladness of sunshine, it needs
no words to convince us of the utility and of the beneficence
of sunbeams. So we will not take midsummer.
Let us take midwinter. Take this very Christmas season
when the days are short and cheerless, the nights
are long and dark and cold. We might be tempted to
think that the sun had well-nigh forgotten us. It is
true he only seems to pay us very occasional visits, and
between fogs and clouds we in England see but little
of him; but, visible or invisible, the sun incessantly
tends us, and provides for our welfare in ways that
perhaps we do not always remember.</p>

<p>Let me give an illustration of what I mean. You
will go back this dull and cold afternoon to the happy
home where your Christmas holidays are being enjoyed.
It will be quite dark ere you get there, for the sun in
these wintry days sets so very early. You will gather
around a cheerful fire. The curtains will be drawn, the
lamps will be lighted, and the disagreeable weather outside
will be forgotten in the pleasant warmth and light
within. Five o’clock has arrived, the pretty wicker table
has been placed near mamma’s chair; on it are the cups
and saucers and the fancy teapot. Under the table is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
a little shelf, with some tempting cakes and a tender
muffin. Two or three welcome friends have joined the
little group, and a delightful half-hour is sure to follow.</p>

<p>But you may say, “What have tea and muffins,
lamps and fireplaces to do with the sun? Are they
not all mere artificial devices, as far removed as possible
from the sunbeams or the natural beauties which
sunbeams create?” Well, not so far, perhaps, as you
may think. Let us see.</p>

<p>Poke up the fire, and while it is throwing forth that
delicious warmth, and charming but flickering light,
we will try to discover where that light and heat have
come from. No doubt they have come from the coal,
but then, whence came the coal? It came from the
mine, where brave colliers hewed it out deep under the
ground, and then it was hoisted to the surface by steam
engines. Our inquiry must not stop here, for another
question immediately arises, as to how this wonderful
fuel came into the earth? When we examine coal carefully,
by using the microscope to see its structure, we
find that it is not like a stone; it is composed of trees
and other plants, the leaves and stems of which can be
sometimes recognized. Indeed, the fossil trunks and
roots of the great trees are occasionally conspicuous
in the coal-pit. It is quite plain that these are only
the remains of a vegetation which was formerly growing
and flourishing, and on further inquiry we learn
that coal must have been produced in the following
<span class="locked">manner:—</span></p>

<p>Once upon a time a great forest flourished. The
sun shone down on this forest, and it was watered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
by genial showers, while insects and other creatures
sported in its shades. It is true that the trees and
plants were not like those we now see about us. They
were more like ferns and mare’s-tails and gigantic club-mosses.
In the fulness of time they died, and fell, and
decayed, and others sprang up to meet the like end.
Thus it happened that, in course of ages, the remains
of leaves, and fruits, and trunks accumulated over the
soil. The forest was situated near the seashore, and
then a remarkable change took place—the land began
slowly to sink. You need not think that this is impossible.
Land has often been known to change its
level gradually. In fact, a sinking process is slowly
going on now in many places on the earth, while the
land is rising in other localities. As the forest gradually
sank lower and lower, the sea-water began to inundate
it, and all the trees perished until, at last, deep water
submerged the surface which had once been covered
by a fine forest. At the bottom of this sea lay the
decaying vegetation.</p>

<p>That which was the destruction of the growing
forest, proved to be the means of preserving its
remains, for, then as now, the rivers flowed into the
sea, and the waters of the rivers, especially in times
of flood, carried down with them clay or mud, held in
suspension. Upon the floor of the ocean this material
was slowly deposited; and thus a coating of mud overlay
the remains of the forest. In the course of ages,
these layers grew thick and heavy, and hardened into a
great flat rock, while the trunks and leaves underneath
were squeezed together by the weight, and packed into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
a solid mass which became black, and in the course of
time was transformed into coal.</p>

<p>After ages and ages had passed by, the bed of the
sea ceased to sink, and began slowly to rise. The water
over the newly made layers of stone became shallower,
and at last the floor was raised until it emerged from
the sea. But, of course, it would not be the original
ground which formed the surface of the newly uncovered
land. The sheets of consolidated clay lay on the
top; over the fresh surface life gradually spread, until
man himself came to dwell there, while far beneath his
feet the remains of the ancient vegetation were buried.</p>

<p>When we now dig down through the rocks we come
upon the portions of trees and other plants which the
lapse of time, and the influence of pressure, have turned
from leaves and wood into our familiar coal.</p>

<p>That ancient forest grew because sunbeams abounded
in those early times, and nourished a luxuriant vegetation.
The heat and the light then expended so liberally
by the sun were seized by the leaves of flourishing
plants, and were stored away in their stems and foliage.
Thus it is that the ancient sunbeams have been preserved
in our coal-beds for uncounted thousands of
years. When we put a lump of coal on our fire this
evening, and when it sends forth a grateful warmth
and cheerful light, it but reproduces for our benefit
some of that store of preserved sunbeams of which our
earth holds so large a treasure. Thus, the sun has
contributed very materially to our comfort, for it has
provided the fire to keep us warm.</p>

<p>The orb of day has, however, ministered further to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
our tea party, for has it not produced the tea itself?
The tea grew a long way off, most likely in China, where
the plant was matured by the warmth of the sunbeams.
From China the tea-chests were brought by a sailing
vessel to London; the ship performed this long voyage
by the use of sails, blown by what we call wind, which
is merely the passage of great volumes of air as they
hurry from one part of the earth to another.</p>

<p>We may ask what makes the air move, for it will
not rush about in this way unless there be considerable
force to drive it. Here again we perceive the influence
of the sun. Tracts of land are warmed by the genial
sunbeams. The air receives the heat from the land,
and the warm air is buoyant and ascends, while cooler
air continually flows in to supply its place. To do this
it has, of course, to rush across the country, and thus
wind is caused. All the air currents on our earth are
consequently due to the sun. You see, therefore, how
greatly we are indebted to our brilliant luminary for the
enjoyment of our tea-table. Not only has the sun given
us the coal and the tea, but it has actually provided the
means by which the tea was carried all the way from
China to our own shores.</p>

<p>We can also trace the connection between the hot
water and the sun. Of course, the water has come
immediately from the kettle, and that has been taken
from the fire, and the fire was produced by sunbeams.
Thus we learn that it is the warmth of the sun that has
made the water boil. If you visit the water-works you
will see great reservoirs. In some cases they have been
filled by a river, sometimes the water is pumped from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
deep well in the ground, sometimes it is the surface-water
caught on a mountain side. Whatever be the
immediate source of our water supply, the real origin is
to be sought, not in the earth beneath, but in the
heavens above. All the water we use day by day has
come from the clouds. It is the clouds which sent
down the rain, or sometimes the snow, or the hail, and
it is this water from the clouds which fills our rivers.
It is this water also which sinks deep into the earth and
supplies our wells, so that from whatever apparent
source the water seems to have come, it is indeed the
clouds which have been the real benefactors. The water
in your teacup to-night was, a little while ago, in a cloud,
floating far overhead in the sky.</p>

<p>We may look a little further and find whence the
clouds have come. It is certain that clouds are merely
a form of steam or vapor of water, and as they are so
continually sending down rain on the earth, there must
be some means by which their supply will be replenished.
Here again our excellent friend the sun is to be
found ever helping us secretly, if not helping us openly.
He pours down his rich and warm beams on the great
oceans, and the heat turns some of the water into vapor,
which, being lighter than the air, ascends upwards for
miles. There the vapor often passes into the form of
clouds, and the winds waft these clouds to refresh the
thirsty lands of the earth. Thus, you see, it is the sun
which procures for us water from the great oceans which
cover so much of our globe, and sends it on by the
winds to supply our water-works, and fill our teapots.
Notice another little kindliness of our great benefactor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
The water of the oceans is quite salt. But we could
not make tea with salt water, so the sun, when lifting
the vapor from the sea, most thoughtfully leaves all the
salt behind, and thus provides us with the purest of
sweet water.</p>

<p>That nice muffin was baked by the sun, toasted by
the sun, and made from wheat grown by the sun. If
the wheat was ground in a wind-mill, then the sun
raised the wind which turned the mill. Perhaps the
flour-mill was driven by steam, in which case the sun,
long ago, provided the coal for the boiler. The miller
might have lived on a river and used a water-mill, but
if he did, then here again the sun actually did the work.
The sun raised the water to the clouds, and after it had
fallen in rain, and was on its way back to the sea, its
descent was utilized to turn the water-wheel. The water
derives its power to turn the mill from the fact that it
is running downhill, but it could not run down unless
it had first been raised up; and thus it is indeed the sun
which drives the water-wheel. Nor can the baker dispense
with the sun’s aid even if he rejected wind-mills, or
steam-mills, or water-mills, and determined to grind the
corn himself with a pestle and mortar. Here, at least,
it might be thought that it is a man’s sinews and muscles
that are doing the work, and so no doubt they are. But
you are mistaken if you think the sun has not rendered
indispensable aid. The sun has just as surely provided
the power which moves the baker’s arms as it has raised
the wind which turned the wind-mill. The force exerted
in grinding with the pestle has been derived from the
food that the man has eaten; that food was grown by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
the sun, and the man received from the food the energy
it had derived from the sun’s heat. So that, look at it
any way you please, even for the grinding of the wheat
to make the muffin for your tea party, you are wholly
indebted to the sun.</p>

<p>It is the sun which has bleached the tablecloth to
that snowy whiteness. The sun has given those bright
colors which look so pretty in the girls’ dresses. With
how much significance can we say and feel that light is
pleasant to the eye, and what prettier name than Little
Sunbeam can we have for the darling child who makes
our home so bright?</p>

<h3>THE DISTANCE OF THE SUN.</h3>

<p>The sun is a very long way off. It is not easy for
you to imagine a distance so great, but if you want to
learn astronomy you must make the attempt. This is
the first measurement that we shall have to make on
our way to that far-off country called Star-Land; but
long as we shall find it to be, we shall afterwards have
to consider distances very much longer. When you are
out in the street, or taking a walk in the country, you
can see at once that this man is near, or that house is
far, or that mountain is many miles away. This is
because you have other objects between to help you to
judge of the distances of these different objects. You
will see, for example, that there are many houses or
farmyards, and you will notice hedges dividing different
fields between you and the mountain. You also see
that there are woods and parks, and perhaps stretches
of moorland extending up the slopes. You have an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
impression that the farmyards and fields are of considerable
size, and that the woods or moors are wide and
extensive; and putting these things together, you
realize that the mountain must be miles away.</p>

<p>But when we look at the sun we have no aids conveniently
placed to help us in judging his distance.
There are no intervening objects, and merely gazing
at the sun helps us but little in obtaining any accurate
knowledge. We must go to the astronomer and ask
him to tell us how far he has found the sun to be, and
then we must also beg from him some explanation of
the method he has used in making his measurements.</p>

<p>It has been found that the sun is, on the average,
about ninety-three millions of miles from the earth; but
sometimes it is a little further and sometimes it is a little
nearer. Let us first try to count 93,000,000. The easiest
way will be to get the clock to do this for us; and here
is a sum that I would suggest for you to work out.
How long will the clock have to tick before it has made
as many ticks as there are miles between the earth and
the sun? Every minute the clock, of course, makes
60 ticks, and in 24 hours the total number will reach
86,400. By dividing this into 93,000,000 you will find
that more than 1076 days, or nearly three years, will
be required for the clock to perform the task.</p>

<p>We may consider the subject in another way, and
find how long an express train would take to go all the
way from the earth to the sun. We shall suppose the
speed of the train to be 40 miles an hour; and if
the train ran for a whole day and a whole night without
stopping, it would then accomplish 960 miles. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
a year the distance travelled would reach 350,400 miles,
and by dividing this into 93,000,000 we arrive at the
conclusion that a train would have to travel at a pace
of 40 miles an hour, not alone for days and for weeks
and for years, but even for centuries. Indeed, not until
265 years had elapsed would the mighty journey have
been ended. Even though King Charles I. had been
present when the train began to move, the destination
would not yet have been reached. No one who started
in the train could expect to reach the end of the trip.
That would not occur till the time of his great-great-grandchildren.</p>

<h3>HOW ASTRONOMERS MEASURE THE DISTANCES OF THE
HEAVENLY BODIES.</h3>

<p>I shall so often have to speak of the distances of the
celestial bodies that I may once for all explain how it is
that we have been able to discover what these distances
are. This would be a very puzzling matter if we were
to try and describe it fully, but the principle of the
method is not at all difficult. Do you know why you
have been provided with two eyes? It is undoubted
that one of the reasons is to aid you in estimating distances.
You see this boy (<a href="#ifig_4">Fig. 4</a>) judges of the distance
of his finger by the inclination of his two eyes when
directed at it. In a similar way we judge of the distance
of a heavenly body by making observations on it
from two different stations.</p>

<div id="ifig_4" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img src="images/i_p020.jpg" width="371" height="308" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>—Two Eyes are better than One.</div></div>

<div id="ifig_5" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img src="images/i_p021.jpg" width="428" height="505" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>—How we measured the Height of the Ball.</div></div>

<p>I shall illustrate our method of measuring the actual
distance of a body in the heavens by showing you how
we can find the height of that large india-rubber ball<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
which is hanging from the ceiling. Of course, I do not
intend to have a measuring tape from the ball itself,
because I want to solve the problem on the same principle
as that by which we measure the distance of the sun
or of any other celestial body which we cannot reach.
I will ask the aid of a boy and a girl, who will please
stand one at each end of the lecture table. The apparatus
we shall want is very simple; it consists of two
cards and a pair of scissors. The boy will kindly shape
his card to such an angle that when he holds it to his
eye one side of the angle shall point straight at the
little girl, and the other side shall point straight at the
ball, just as you see in the picture (<a href="#ifig_5">Fig. 5</a>). The girl
will also please do the same with her card, so that along
one side she just sees the little boy’s face, while the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
side points up to the ball. It will be necessary to cut
these angles properly. If the angle be too big, then
when one side points to the boy’s face, the other will be
directed above the ball. If the angle on the card be
too small, then one side will be directed below the ball,
while the other is pointed to the boy. The whole
accuracy of our little observations depends upon cutting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
the card angles properly. When they have been truly
shaped it will be easy to find the distance of the ball.
We first take a foot rule and measure the length of our
table from one of our young friends to the other. That
length is twelve feet, and to discover
the distance of the ball we must make
a drawing. We get a sheet of paper,
and first rule a line twelve inches
long. That will represent the length
of the table, it being understood that
each inch of the drawing is to correspond
to a foot of the actual table.
Let the end where the girl stood
be marked <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>, and that of the boy, <span class="smcap smaller">A</span>,
and now bring the cards and place
them on the line just as shown in the
figure. The card the girl has shaped is to be put so
that the corner of it lies at <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>, and one edge along <span class="smcap smaller">B A</span>.
Then the boy’s card is to be so put that its corner is
at <span class="smcap smaller">A</span> and one edge along <span class="smcap smaller">A B</span>. Next with a pencil we
rule lines on the other edges of the cards, taking care
that they are kept all the time in their proper positions.
These two lines carried on will meet at <span class="smcap smaller">C</span>; and this
must be the position of the ball on the scale of our little
sketch. It only now remains to take the foot rule and
measure on the drawing the length from <span class="smcap smaller">A</span> to <span class="smcap smaller">C</span>. I
find it to be twenty inches, and I have so arranged it
that the distance from <span class="smcap smaller">B</span> to <span class="smcap smaller">C</span> is the same.</p>

<div id="ifig_6" class="figleft" style="max-width: 9em;">
  <img src="images/i_p022.jpg" width="135" height="198" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>—This is what we wanted the Cards for.</div></div>

<p>I do not intend to trouble you much with Euclid in
these lectures, but as many of my young friends have
learned the sixth book, I will just refer to the well-known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
proposition, which tells us that the lengths of
the corresponding sides of two similar triangles are proportional.
We have here two similar triangles. There
is the big one with the boy at one corner, the girl at
the other, and the ball overhead. Here is the small
triangle which we have just drawn. These triangles
are similar because they have got the same angles, and
it was to insure that they should have the same angles
that we were so careful in shaping the cards. As these
two triangles are similar, their sides must be proportional.
We have agreed that the line <span class="smcap smaller">A B</span>, which is
twelve inches long, is to represent the length of the
table between the little boy and girl. Hence the distance,
<span class="smcap smaller">A C</span>, must, on the same scale, be the interval
between the ball and the boy at the end. This is
twenty inches on the drawing, and therefore the actual
distance from the end of the table to the ball is twenty
feet.</p>

<p>Hence you see that without going up to the ball or
having a string from it, or in any other way making
direct communication with it, we have been able to
ascertain how far up in the air the ball is actually hung.
This simple illustration explains the principle of the
method by which astronomers are able to learn the distances
of the different celestial bodies from the earth.
You must think of the sun, the moon, and the stars as
globes supported in some manner over our heads, and
we seek to discover their distances from measurements
of angles made at the ends of a base-line.</p>

<div id="ifig_7" class="figright" style="max-width: 9em;">
  <img src="images/i_p024.jpg" width="143" height="334" alt="" />
  <div class="captionj"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>—This would be our Base-line when
finding the Sun’s Distance.</div></div>

<p>Of course, astronomers must choose two stations
which are far more widely separated than are those in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
our little experiment. In fact, the greater the interval
between the two stations, the better. Astronomers
require a much longer distance than from one side of
this room to the other, or from one side of London to
the other side. If it were merely a balloon at which
we were looking, then, when one observer at one side
of London and another at the opposite side shaped their
cards carefully, we should be able to tell the height
of the balloon very easily. But as
the sun is so much further off than
any balloon could ever be, we must
separate the observers much more
widely. Even the breadth of England
would not be enough, so we
have to make them separate more and
more until they are as widely divided
as it is possible for any two people on
this earth to be. One astronomer
takes up his position at <span class="smcap smaller">A</span> (<a href="#ifig_7">Fig. 7</a>),
and the other at the opposite side at
<span class="smcap smaller">B</span>, so that they can both see the sun.
They are obliged to use a much
more accurate way of measuring the
angles than by cutting out cards with
pairs of scissors; and as the astronomer
at <span class="smcap smaller">A</span> is not able to see his friend
at <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>, it becomes no easy matter to measure the angles
accurately. However, we shall not now trouble ourselves
about such difficulties. It may suffice for the
present to know that the angles are measured by delicate
and very accurate instruments used by astronomers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
They will not, indeed, make a little sketch such as
sufficed for our purpose. They make a calculation
which is a much more accurate way of effecting true
measurement. The astronomers know the size of the
earth, and thus they know how many thousands of
miles lie between the two stations where the observations
are made. This distance means in their calculation
just what the length of the table did in our sketch.
From each end of the line they set off an angle just as
we did, and the astronomer must use the principle of
similar triangles which he finds in Euclid, just we had
to do. At last, when they have calculated the sides of
their triangle, they obtain the distance of the sun.</p>

<h3>THE APPARENT SMALLNESS OF DISTANT OBJECTS.</h3>

<div id="ifig_8" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img src="images/i_p025.jpg" width="476" height="197" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span>—The nearer you are, the bigger the Globe looks.</div></div>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span>—The Globe is so far off that it lies beyond the Picture.
The dotted lines show how small it seems.</div></div>

<p>I ought here to explain a principle which those who
are learning about the stars must always bear in mind.
The principle asserts that the further a body is, the
smaller it looks. Perhaps this will be understood from
the adjoining little sketch (<a href="#ifig_8">Fig. 8</a>). It represents a
great globe, on which oceans and continents are shown,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
and you see a little boy and a little girl are looking at
the globe. The girl stands quite close to it, and I have
drawn two dotted lines from her eye, one to the top of
the globe, and the other to the under surface. If she
wants to examine the entire side of the globe which is
visible to her, she must first look along the upper dotted
line, and then she must turn her glance downwards
until she comes to the lower line, and having to turn
her eyes thus up and down she will think the globe is
very big, and she will be quite right. The boy is, as
you see, on the other side of the globe, but I have put
him much further off than the girl. I have also drawn
two dotted lines from his eye to the globe, and it is
plain that he will not have to turn his head much up
and down to see the whole globe. He can take it all
in at a glance, and to him, therefore, the globe will
appear to be comparatively small, because he is sufficiently
far from it. The more distant he is, the smaller
it will appear. You can easily imagine that, if the
globe were far enough, the two lines that would include
the whole would be like those shown (<a href="#ifig_9">Fig. 9</a>), in which
the globe is so distant that it cannot be seen in the
picture. The apparent size of the globe, which is
really measured by the angle between these two lines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
would always be smaller and smaller according as the
distance was greater. Now you can understand why
an object seems smaller the further away it is; indeed,
when sufficiently far, the object ceases to be visible
at all.</p>

<p>I could give many illustrations of the diminution of
size by distance, and so, doubtless, could you. Every
boy knows that his kite looks smaller and smaller the
greater the length of string that he lets out. I have
seen in the West of Ireland a bird that seemed like a
little speck high up near the clouds, but from its flight
and other circumstances I knew that the speck was not
a little bird. It was, indeed, a great eagle, which was
dwarfed by the elevation to which it had soared.</p>

<p>It is in astronomy that we have the best illustrations
of this principle. Enormous objects seem to be small
because they are so very far off. You must therefore
always remember that although an object may appear
to be small, this appearance may be only a delusion.
It may be that the object is very big, but very distant.
In astronomy, this is almost always the case, there is so
much room above us, around us, on all sides in space.
Look up at the ceiling. It certainly does not bound
space, for there is another side to it; and then there is
the roof of the house. But the roof is not a boundary,
for, of course, there is the air above it, and then, higher
up still, there are the clouds, and so we can carry our
imagination on and on through and beyond the air up
to where the stars are, and still on and on. And as
there is unlimited room, the celestial bodies take advantage
of it, and are, generally speaking, at distances so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
gigantic that, no matter how small they may appear,
their smallness is merely deceptive.</p>

<p>Let us try to illustrate in another way the exceeding
remoteness of the sun. So please imagine that you
were on the sun, and that you took a view of our earth
from that distance. To find out what we must expect
to see, let us think of a balloon voyage. If you were
to go up in a balloon, you would at first see only the
houses, or objects immediately about you, but as you
rose the view would become wider and wider. You
would see that London was surrounded by the country,
and then, as you still soared up and up, the sea would
become visible, and you would be able to trace out the
coasts, east and west and south. If, in some way, you
could soar higher than any balloon could carry you, the
whole of the British Islands would presently lie spread
like a map beneath. Still on and on, and then the
continent of Europe would be gradually opened out,
until the great oceans, and even other continents, would
at last be caught sight of, and then you would perceive
that our whole earth was indeed a globe. The higher
you went, the less distinctly would you be able to see
the details on the surface. At last the outlines of the
continents and oceans would fade, and you would begin
to lose any perception of the shape of the earth itself.
Long ere you had reached the distance of the sun, the
earth would look merely as the planet Venus now does
to us. It is instructive to consider how small our earth
would seem if it were possible to view it from the sun.
Think of that very familiar little globe, a lawn-tennis
ball, which is two and three-quarter inches in diameter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
But suppose a tennis ball were at the opposite side of
the street, or still further away; suppose, for example,
that it were half a mile away, what could you expect
to see of it? And yet the earth, as seen from the sun,
would appear to be no larger than a tennis ball would
look when viewed from a distance of half a mile.</p>

<h3>THE SHAPE AND SIZE OF THE SUN.</h3>

<p>We have spoken of the heat of the sun, how hot he
is; of the distance of the sun, how far he is; and now
we must say a little about the size of the sun; and also
about his shape. It is plain that the sun is round, that
it has the shape of a ball. We are sure of this because,
though a plate is circular, yet, if it were placed so that
we only saw it edgeways from a distance, it would not
appear to be round. The sun is always rotating, and
as it always seems to be a circle, we are therefore certain
that the true shape of the sun must be globular,
and not merely circular like a flat plate.</p>

<p>In the middle of the day, when the sun is high in the
heavens, it is impossible for us to form a notion of the
size of the sun. People will form very different estimates
as to his apparent bigness. Some will say he
looks as large as a dinner plate, but such statements
are meaningless, unless we say where the plate is to be
held. If it be near the eye, of course the plate may
hide the sun, and, for that matter, everything else also.
If the plate were about a hundred feet away, then it
would often hide the sun. If the plate were more than
a hundred feet distant, then it could not hide the sun entirely,
and the further the plate, the smaller it would seem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
No means of estimating the sun’s size are available
when his orb stands high in the heavens. But when
he is rising or setting, we see that he passes behind
trees or mountains, so that there are intervening objects
with which we can compare him; then we have
actual proof that the sun must be a very large body
indeed.</p>

<div id="ifig_10" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 26em;">
  <img src="images/i_p030.jpg" width="415" height="473" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>—A Sunset viewed from Marseilles (<cite>Marcus Codde</cite>).</div></div>

<p>I give here a picture, by Marcus Codde, taken from a
French journal, <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l’Astronomie</cite>, which gives a charming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
illustration of a sunset at Marseilles (<a href="#ifig_10">Fig. 10</a>). If you
wish to see that the sun is bigger than a mountain,
you may go to the top of Notre Dame de la Garde,
but you must choose either the 10th of February or the
31st of October for your visit, because it is only on the
evenings of those days that the sun sets in the right
position.</p>

<p>On both these evenings the sun sinks directly behind
Mount Carigou in the Pyrenees; this mountain is a long
way from Marseilles—no less, indeed, than one hundred
and fifty-eight miles. But the mountain is so lofty,
that when the sky is clear, the summit can be distinctly
seen upon the sun as a background, in the way shown in
the picture. This must be a very pretty sight, and it
teaches us an important lesson. The sun is further
away than the mountain, and yet you see the sun on
both sides of the mountain, and above it. Here, then,
we learn without any calculations, that the sun must be
bigger than the upper part of a great mountain in the
Pyrenees.</p>

<p>When we calculate the size of the sun from the
measurements made by astronomers, we discover that
it is much bigger than Mount Carigou; we see that
even the entire range of the Pyrenees, the whole of
Europe, and even our whole globe, are insignificant by
comparison.</p>

<div id="ifig_11" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img src="images/i_p032.jpg" width="439" height="339" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>—How we compare the Earth and the Sun.</div></div>

<p>There is a football on the table, shown in <a href="#ifig_11">Fig. 11</a>.
We shall suppose it to represent the sun; we shall now
choose something else to represent the earth. We must,
however, exhibit the proportions accurately. A tennis
ball will not do; it is far too large. The fact is, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
width of the earth is less than the one-hundredth
part of the width of the sun. The tennis ball is, however,
only a quarter the width of the football, so we
must choose something a good deal smaller. I try
with a marble, even with the smallest marble I can
find, but when I measure it, I find that one hundred
such marbles, placed side by side, would be far longer
than the width of the football; I must therefore look
for something still smaller. A grain of small-sized shot
will give the right size for the model of our earth.
About one hundred of these grains placed side by side
will extend to a length equal to the width of the
football. Now you will be able to form some conception
of how enormous the sun really is. Think of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
this earth, how big we find it when we begin to travel.
What a tremendous voyage we have to take to get to
New Zealand, and even then we have only got halfway
round the globe. Then think that the sun is in
the same proportion bigger than the earth as that football
is bigger than that grain of shot. If a million of
such grains of shot were melted and cast into one
globe, it would not be so large as that football. If a
million globes, as large as our earth, could be united
together, no doubt a vast globe would be produced, but
it would not be so large as the sun. Think of a single
house, with three or four people living in it, and then
think of this mighty London, with its millions of inhabitants.
The house will represent our earth, while great
London represents the sun!</p>

<h3>THE SPOTS ON THE SUN.</h3>

<p>I have shown you that the sun is intensely hot, and
a very long way off, and enormously big. And now we
have to describe the appearance of the surface of the sun
when we examine it closely.</p>

<div id="ifig_12" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_p034.jpg" width="399" height="430" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>—Looking at the Sun.</div></div>

<p>If you get a piece of very dark glass, or if you smoke
a piece of glass over a candle, then you can look directly
at the sun with comfort. A nicer plan is to prick a
pinhole in a card, through which you can look at the
sun without any inconvenience. Generally speaking, a
view of the sun in this way will show you only a uniformly
bright surface. To study the face of our great
luminary carefully, you must use the aid which the
telescope gives to the astronomer. A very good way of
doing this is shown in <a href="#ifig_12">Fig. 12</a>. A small telescope,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
fixed on a stand, is pointed to the sun, and, the eyepiece
being drawn out somewhat further than when direct
observations are being made, the sun draws its own
picture on a screen. This may be examined without
any inconvenience, or without the necessity for any
protection to the eye, and a number of young astronomers
can all view the sun at the same moment. On
such a picture you will generally see the brilliant surface
marked with dark spots, which are sometimes as
numerous as in the case represented in <a href="#ifig_13">Fig. 13</a>. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
spots present very different appearances according to
circumstances. One such spot when seen with a very
powerful telescope showed the wonderful structure
which is represented in <a href="#ifig_14">Fig. 14</a>.</p>

<div id="ifig_13" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23em;">
  <img src="images/i_p035.jpg" width="366" height="364" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span>—This is what the Sun sometimes looks like.</div></div>

<p>The visible surface of the sun is entirely formed of
intensely heated vapors. We might almost say that
the spots are holes, by which we can look through the
brilliant surface to the interior and darker parts. Sometimes
the spots close up, and fresh ones will open elsewhere.
Now and then the whole surface is mottled
over in a remarkable way. I give here a picture which
was taken from Mr. Nasmyth’s beautiful drawing, in
which he shows how the sun sometimes assumes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
appearance which has been likened to willow leaves
(<a href="#ifig_15">Fig. 15</a>). This appearance was very noticeable in the
great spot of September, 1898.</p>

<div id="ifig_14" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img src="images/i_p036.jpg" width="314" height="312" alt="" />

  <img src="images/i_p038.jpg" width="382" height="476" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span>—Spot nearing the Sun’s Edge.</div></div>

<p>The spots often last long enough to demonstrate a
remarkable fact. We must remember that the sun is a
great globe, and that it is poised freely in space. There
is nothing to hold it up, and there is nothing to prevent
it from turning round. That it does turn round, we
can prove by careful observation of the spots. I can
best illustrate what I want by <a href="#ifig_17">Fig. 17</a>, which shows six
imaginary pictures. The first represents the sun on the
1st day of the month; the next shows it five days later,
on the 6th; another view is five days later still, on the
11th; and so on until the last picture, which corresponds
to the 26th. You see, on the first day there is a spot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
near the left edge; by the 6th, this spot is near the
middle; by the 11th, it is near the right edge; then you
do not see it at all on the 16th, or on the 21st; but on
the 26th it is back in the same place from which it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
started. We find other spots to have a similar history.
They appear to move across the face, and then to return
in a little less than four weeks to the same place where
they were originally noticed. These appearances can be
illustrated very simply by cutting a small hole through
the rind of an orange down to the white interior skin,
which may be darkened with ink. Put a knitting
needle through the axis of the orange, and then turn it
slowly round. The spot will be found to go through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
the changes that we have seen. We start with the spot
near the left, it moves across the face, and then passes
to invisibility by moving behind the globe until it reappears
again, after having moved round the back. As
the same may be observed with every spot which lasts
long enough, we learn that the changes in the places
must be produced by the turning round of the sun.
Here you see is the way in which an astronomical discovery
is made. We first observe the fact that the
spots do always appear to move. Then we try to
account for this, and we find a very simple explanation,
by supposing that the whole sun, spots and all, turns
steadily round and round. It can also be proved in a
very conclusive manner that no other explanation is
possible. This rotation of the sun is always going on
uniformly, and some curious consequences follow from
it. The view of the sun which is turned towards us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
to-day is quite different from that which was towards us
a fortnight ago, or from that which we shall see in a
fortnight hence. There is no actual or visible axis
about which the sun rotates. In this the sun is like
the earth and other celestial bodies.</p>

<h3>APPEARANCES SEEN DURING A TOTAL ECLIPSE
OF THE SUN.</h3>

<p>For a great deal of our knowledge about the sun
we are indebted to the moon. It will sometimes
happen that the moon comes in between us and the
sun, and produces an eclipse. At first you might
think that an eclipse would only have the effect of
preventing us from seeing anything of the sun, but it
really reveals most beautiful and interesting objects, of
whose existence we should otherwise be ignorant. The
great luminary has curious appendages which are quite
hidden under ordinary circumstances. In the full glare
of day the dazzling splendor of the sun obliterates and
renders invisible these appendages, which only shine with
comparatively feeble light. It fortunately happens that
the moon is just large enough to intercept the whole of
the direct light from the sun, or rather, I should say,
from the central parts of the sun. Surrounding that
central and more familiar part from which the brilliancy
is chiefly derived is a remarkable fringe of delicate and
beautiful objects which are self-luminous no doubt, but
with a light so feeble that when presented to us amid
the full blaze of sunlight they are invisible. When,
however, the moon so kindly stops all the stronger
beams, then these faint objects spring into visibility,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
and we have the exquisite spectacle of a total eclipse.
The objects that I desire to mention particularly are
the corona and the prominences.</p>

<div id="ifig_18" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_p041.jpg" width="397" height="567" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span>—Total Eclipse of the Sun, May 6, 1883 (<cite>drawn
by Trouvelot</cite>).</div></div>

<p>A pretty picture of the total eclipse of the sun which
occurred on May 6, 1883, is here shown (<a href="#ifig_18">Fig. 18</a>). It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
is taken from a drawing made by M. Trouvelot, who
was sent out with a French observing party. They
went a very long way to see an eclipse, but what they
saw recompensed them for all their trouble. The track
along which the phenomenon could be best seen lay in
the Pacific Ocean, and a place had to be selected which
was so situated that the sun should be high in the
heavens at the important moment, and also that the
duration while the total eclipse lasted should be as long
as possible. They accordingly went to Caroline Island,
and all this journey to the other side of the earth was
taken to witness a phenomenon that only lasted five
minutes and twenty-three seconds. Short though these
precious minutes were, they were long enough to enable
good work to be done. Careful preparations had been
made so that not a moment should be thrown away.
Each member of the party had his special duty allotted
to him, and this had been rehearsed so carefully beforehand
that when the long-expected moment of “totality”
arrived there was neither haste nor confusion; every
one carefully went through his part of the programme.
M. Trouvelot, for instance, occupied himself for two
minutes and a few seconds in making the sketch that
we now show. No doubt an accomplished astronomical
artist like M. Trouvelot would gladly have taken longer
time for his sketch of so unique a sight, but brevity was
imperative. He had already had experience of similar
eclipses, so that he was prepared at once to note what
ought to be noted, and the picture we have shown is
the result. This was completed within less than half
of the duration of totality, and the artist had still three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
minutes left to devote to another and quite different
part of the work, which does not concern us at present.</p>

<div id="ifig_19" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img src="images/i_p043.jpg" width="466" height="585" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>—The Corona of the Sun, 1882 (<cite>by Schuster</cite>).</div></div>

<p>I want you particularly to look at these long branches
or projections which we see surrounding the sun when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
totally eclipsed. They shine with a pearly light, and,
in fact, it is stated that even during the gloomiest portion
of the time there was still as much illumination as
on a bright moonlight night. All that light came from
this glorious halo round the sun which astronomers call
the “corona.” We do not under ordinary circumstances
obtain even the slightest glimpse of this object. Even
during a partial eclipse of the sun it is not visible, but
directly the moon quite covers the sun, so as to cut off all
the direct light, then the corona springs into visibility.
It is always there, no doubt, though we cannot see it.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting photographs of the
eclipsed sun which has ever been taken was that by
Professor Schuster in 1882 (<a href="#ifig_19">Fig. 19</a>). The corona is
well shown, and also a comet.</p>

<p>The other appendages to the sun which can be
seen during an eclipse are the objects which we call
“prominences.” They are of a ruddy color, and seem
to be great flames, which leap upwards from the glowing
surface of the sun below. Though the existence of
the prominences was first discovered by their presence
during eclipses, it fortunately happens that we are no
longer wholly dependent on eclipses for the purpose of
making our observations of these remarkable objects.
It is true that we may look at the sun with even the
biggest and most powerful telescope in the world, and
still not be able to perceive anything of the prominences.
We require the aid of a special appliance called
the spectroscope to render them visible. But I am not
now going to describe this ingenious contrivance. I am
only going to speak of the results which have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
obtained by its means. We shall here again avail ourselves
of the experience of M. Trouvelot for a picture
of two of these wonderful appendages.</p>

<div id="ifig_20" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_p045.jpg" width="400" height="480" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span>—Solar Prominences (<cite>drawn by Trouvelot</cite>).</div></div>

<p>The view (<a href="#ifig_20">Fig. 20</a>) shows the ordinary aspect of the
sun diversified with groups of dark spots. The fringe
around the margin of the globe is of some ruddy material,
forming the base of the flames which rise from the
glowing surface. No doubt these flames are also often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
present on the face of the sun, but we cannot see them
against the brilliant background. They are only perceptible
when shown against the sky behind. At two
points of this ruddy fringe, which happen curiously
enough to be nearly opposite to each other, two colossal
flames have burst forth. They extend to a vast distance,
which is quite one-third of the width of the sun.
The vigor of these outbreaks may be estimated by the
remarkable changes which are incessantly going on.
These great flames may indeed be said to flicker; only,
considering their size, we must allow them a little more
time than is demanded for the movements of flames of
ordinary dimensions. The great flame on the left was
obviously declining in brilliancy when first seen. In a
quarter of an hour it had broken up into fragments,
some of which were still to be seen floating in the
sun’s atmosphere. In ten minutes more the light of
this flame had almost entirely vanished. Surely these
are changes of extraordinary rapidity when we remember
the size of this prominence. It was nearly 300,000
miles in height—that is to say, about thirty-seven
times the width of our earth.</p>

<p>Great as are these prominences, others have been
recorded which are even larger. One of them has
been seen to rush up with a speed of 200,000 miles
an hour—that is, with more than two hundred times
the pace of the swiftest of rifle-bullets.</p>

<h3>NIGHT AND DAY.</h3>

<p>The sun is bright, and the earth is dark. The sun
gives light and heat, and the earth receives light and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
heat. We should be in utter darkness were it not for
the sun; at least, all the light we should have, beyond
our trivial artificial light, would come from the feeble
twinkle of the stars. The moon would be no use, for
the brightness of the moon is merely the reflection of
the sunbeams. Were the sun’s light completely extinguished
we could never again see the moon, and we
should also miss from the sky a few other bodies, which
we call planets, such as Jupiter and Venus, Mars and
Saturn. But the stars would be the same as before, for
they do not depend upon the sun for their light. We
shall, indeed, afterwards see that each star is itself a sun.</p>

<p>Picture to yourself the earth as receiving a stream
of sunbeams. These beams fall on one half of our
globe, and give to it the brilliance of day. The other
half of the earth of course receives no sunlight. It is
in the shadow, and consequently the darkness of night
there prevails. The boundary between light and darkness
is not quite sharply defined, for the pleasant twilight
softens it a little, so that we pass gradually from
day to night. Looking at the progress of the sun in
the course of the day, we see that he rises far away in
the east, then he gradually moves across the heavens
past the south, and in the evening declines to the west,
sets, and disappears. All through the night the sun is
gradually moving round the opposite side of the earth,
illuminating New Zealand and Japan and other remote
countries, and then gradually working round to the
east, where he starts afresh to give us a new day here.</p>

<p>Our ancestors many ages ago did not know that
the earth was round. They thought it was a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
flat plain, and that it extended endlessly in every
direction. They were, however, much puzzled about
the sun. They could see from the coasts of France
and Spain or Britain that the sun gradually disappeared
in the ocean; they thought that it actually took a
plunge into the sea. This would certainly quench the
glowing sun; and some of the ancients used to think
they heard the dreadful hissing noise when the great
red-hot body dropped into the Atlantic. But there
was here a difficulty. If the sun were to be chilled
down every evening by dropping into the water
hundreds of miles away to the west, how did it happen
that early the next morning he came up as fresh
and as hot as ever, hundreds of miles away to the
east? For this, indeed, it seemed hard to account.
Some said that we had an entirely new sun every
day. The gods started the sun far off in the east, and
after having run its course it perished in the west.
All the night the gods were busy preparing a new
sun to be used on the succeeding day. But this
was thought to be such a waste of good suns that a
more economical theory was afterwards proposed. The
ancients believed that the continents of the earth, so
far as they knew them, were surrounded by a limitless
ocean. At the north, there were high mountains
and ice and snow, which they thought prevented access
to this ocean from civilized regions. Vulcan was the
presiding deity who navigated those wastes of waters,
and to him was intrusted the responsible duty of
saving the sun from extinction. He had a great boat
ready, so that when the sun was just dropping into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
the ocean at sunset he caught it, and during all the
night he paddled with his glorious cargo round by the
north. The glow of the sun during the voyage could
even be sometimes traced in summer over the great
highlands to the north. This, at all events, was their
way of accounting for the long midsummer twilight.
After a tedious night’s voyage Vulcan got round to
the east in good time for sunrise. Then he shot the
sun up with such terrific force that it would go
across the whole sky, and then the industrious deity
paddled back with all his might by the way he had
come, so as to be ready to catch the sun in the evening
and thus repeat his never-ending task.</p>

<h3>THE DAILY ROTATION OF THE EARTH.</h3>

<p>Vulcan and his boat seemed a pretty way of accounting
for the sun’s apparent motion. The chief drawback
was that it was all work and no play for poor Vulcan.
There were also a few other difficulties. Captains of
ships told us that they had sailed out on the great sea,
and that so far from finding that the ocean extended on
and on in one flat plain forever, the water seemed to
bend round, so that, in fact, after sailing far enough in
the same direction, they found that they would be
brought back again to the place from which they started.
They also knew a little about the north. They told us
that there could be no such ocean as that which Vulcan
in this fable was supposed to navigate. It also appeared
that ships had been voyaging all over the globe night
and day in every direction, and that no captain had ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
seen the sun coming down to the sea, and still less had
he ever met with Vulcan in the course of his incessant
voyages. Thus it was discovered that the earth could
not be a never-ending flat, but that it must be a globe,
poised freely in space without any attachment to hold
it up. It was thought that the change from day to
night might be accounted for by supposing that the
sun actually went round the earth through the space
underneath our feet. This is, indeed, what it seems to
do. But there was a great difficulty about this explanation,
which began to be perceived when the size
and distance of the sun were considered. It required
the sun to possess an alarming activity. He would
actually have to rush round a circle one hundred and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
eighty million miles in diameter and complete this
astonishing voyage once every day.</p>

<div id="ifig_21" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img src="images/i_p050.jpg" width="423" height="350" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span>—How we illustrate the Changes between Day and Night.</div></div>

<p>A little reflection will show that a very much simpler
explanation was available. It was shown that the sun
need not revolve round the earth once every day, but
that everything would be explained if the earth itself
turned round in such a way as to produce the changes
from day to night. We may illustrate the case by this
figure (<a href="#ifig_21">Fig. 21</a>). The small globe is the earth, which
I can turn by the handle. The lamp will represent the
sun, and, as at present shown, the side of the earth, on
which England lies, is towards the lamp and in full day.
On the opposite side of the globe are other countries
such as New Zealand, and there it is dark. You see
that by simply turning the handle I can move England
gradually round so that it passes into the dark side, and
then night falls over the country. At the same time
New Zealand is turned round to enjoy the smiles of
day. This is a very simple method of accounting for
the succession of day and night, and it is also the true
method. We have already seen that the sun turns
round, and now we find that the earth also turns, but
the little body, the earth, goes much the faster, for it
makes twenty-five turns while the sun goes round
once.</p>

<p>Our earth is at this moment spinning round at a
speed so great that London moves many hundreds of
miles every hour. A town near the equator would
gallop round at a pace of more than a thousand miles
an hour—quicker, in fact, than a rifle-bullet. Don’t
you think that we ought to perceive that we are being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
whirled about in this terrific fashion? We know that
when we are flying along in a railway train, we feel the
jolting and we hear the noise, and we feel the blast
of air if we put our heads out of window, and we see
the trees as they appear to rush past. All these things
tell us that we are in rapid motion. But suppose these
sensations were absent. Imagine a line so perfectly
laid that no jolts are perceptible, and that no racket is
heard; draw down the blinds so that nothing can be
seen, how then are we to know that we are moving?
Indeed, your grandfathers used to be able to enjoy such
a tranquil locomotion. I remember seeing in my childhood
the fly-boats, as they were called, on the Royal
Canal, wherein passengers were conveyed from Dublin
to the West of Ireland, before the railway was made.
The fly-boat was a sort of Noah’s ark in appearance,
drawn by a horse cantering along the towing-path. In
the cabin of such a vessel, where there was not the
slightest motion of rolling or pitching—nothing but
noiseless gliding along the canal—no one would be
conscious of motion, so long as he did not look through
the cabin windows. No one was ever seasick in a fly-boat;
it was the perfection of travelling for those who
loved ease and quiet.</p>

<p>The motion of the earth round its axis is, so far, like
that of the fly-boat. It is so absolutely smooth that we
do not feel anything, and we only become conscious of
it by looking at outside objects. These are the sun, or
the moon, or the stars. We see these bodies apparently
going through their unvarying rising and setting, just
as, in looking out from the fly-boat, the passengers in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
that quaint old conveyance could see the houses and
trees as they passed.</p>

<p>Seeing is believing; and I should like here, in this
very theatre, to show you that we are actually turning
round; and this I am enabled to do by the kindness of
my distinguished friend, Professor Dewar.</p>

<div id="ifig_22" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21em;">
  <img src="images/i_p054.jpg" width="325" height="501" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span>—A Pendulum.</div></div>

<p>I am tempted to wish that I had Aladdin’s lamp for
the moment, for I would rub it, and when the great
genie appeared, I would bid him take the Royal Institution,
and all of us here, to a place which everybody
has heard of, and nobody has seen—I mean the North
Pole. It would be so easy to describe the experiment
I am about to show you, there. It is not so easy here.
But it will be sufficiently accurate for our purpose to
suppose that we actually have made the voyage, and
that this is the Pole at the centre of the lecture-table.
The direction of the axis round which the earth is
turning is a line pointing up straight to the ceiling.
This lecture-table and all the rest of the theatre is
going round. In about six hours it will have moved
a quarter of the way, and in twenty-four hours it will
have gone completely round. That is, at least, what
would happen if we were actually at the Pole. As we
are not there, for the Pole is many miles away from the
Royal Institution, I must slightly modify this statement,
and say that the table here takes more than twenty-four
hours to go round. And now I want some way of
proving that such is actually the case. There is no use
in our merely looking at it, because we ourselves, and
this whole building, and the whole of London, are all
turning together. What we want is something which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
does not partake of the motion. Here is a heavy leaden
ball (<a href="#ifig_22">Fig. 22</a>). It is fastened to the roof by a fine steel
wire, and you see it swings to and fro with a deliberate
and graceful motion. I want it to oscillate very
steadily, so I draw it to one side and tie it by a piece
of thread to a support, and then I burn the thread, and
the great ball begins to swing to and fro. It would
continue to do so for an hour, or indeed for several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
hours, and it is a peculiarity of this motion that the
vibration always remains in the same direction in space.
Even the rotation of the earth will not affect the plane
of this great pendulum, so far at least as our experiment
is concerned. Here, then, we have a method of testing
my assertion about the turning round of this theatre.
I mark a line on the table, directly underneath the
motion of the ball to and fro. If we could wait for an
hour or so, we should see that the motion of the ball
seemed to have altered to a direction inclined to its
original position, but it is really the table that has
moved, for the direction of the motion of the ball is
unaltered. We cannot, however, wait so long, therefore
I show you the ingenious method which Professor
Dewar has devised. By a beam from the electric light,
he has succeeded in so magnifying the effect that even
in a single minute it is quite obvious that the whole
of this room is distinctly turning round, with respect
to the oscillations of the pendulum. This celebrated
experiment proves by actual inspection that the earth
must be rotating. By measuring the motion we might
even calculate the length of the day, though I do not
say it would be an accurate method of doing so.</p>

<p>The proper way of finding how long the earth takes
to turn round is by observing the stars. Fix on any
star you please, and note it in a certain position to-night;
if you then observe the moment when the star is in the
same place to-morrow, the interval of time that has
elapsed is the true duration of one complete rotation.
When accurately measured its length is found to be
23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds, or about four minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
shorter than the ordinary day, measured from one noon
to the next.</p>

<h3>ANNUAL MOTION OF THE EARTH ROUND THE SUN.</h3>

<div id="ifig_23" class="figleft" style="max-width: 18em;">
  <img src="images/i_p056.jpg" width="280" height="527" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span>—The Changes of the Sun with
the Seasons.</div></div>

<p>I have as yet only been speaking of the <em>daily</em> movements
by which the
sun appears to go
across the heavens
between morning
and evening. We
next consider the
annual movements
which give rise to
the changes of the
seasons. It is now
Christmastide, when
the days are short
and dark, while six
months ago the days
were long and glorious
in the warmth
and brightness of
summer. A similar
recurrence of the
seasons takes place
every year, and thus
we learn that some
great changes alter
the relation between
the earth and the
sun year after year. We must try and explain this.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
Why is it that we enjoy warmth at one season, and
suffer from frost and snow at another?</p>

<p>Note first a great difference between the sun in summer
and the sun in winter. I will ask you to look out
at noon any day when the clouds are absent, and you
will then find the sun at the highest point it reaches
during the day. All the morning the sun has been
gradually climbing from the east; all the afternoon it
will be gradually sinking down to the west. Let us
make the same observation at different parts of the
year. Suppose we take the shortest day in December.
You will look out about twelve o’clock from some situation
which affords a view towards the south, and there,
as shown in the adjoining sketch (<a href="#ifig_23">Fig. 23</a>), is the midwinter
sun.</p>

<p>But now the spring approaches, and the days begin
to lengthen. If you watch the sun you will see it pass
higher and higher every noon until Midsummer Day
is reached, and then the sun at noon is found quite
high up in the sky. As autumn draws near, the sun
at noon creeps downwards again until, when the next
shortest day has come round, we find that it passes just
where it did at the previous midwinter. With unceasing
regularity year after year the sun goes through
these changes. When he is high at noon we have days
both long and warm; when he is low at noon we have
days both short and cold.</p>

<p>Vulcan with his golden boat was naturally expected
to give an explanation of this. As the summer drew
on, each day Vulcan shot out the sun with a stronger
impulse, so that it should ascend higher and higher.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
His greatest effort was made on Midsummer Day, when,
after rowing but a little way round from the north
towards the east, he
drove off the sun with
a terrific effort. The
sun soared aloft to the
utmost height it could
reach, and in the meantime
Vulcan returned
to the west to be ready
to catch the sun as
it descended. On the
other hand, in midwinter,
he came round
much further through
the east to the south,
and then shot up the
sun with his feeblest
effort, and had to
paddle as hard as ever
he could so as to complete
his long return
voyage during the brief
day.</p>

<div id="ifig_24" class="figright" style="max-width: 17em;">
  <img src="images/i_p058.jpg" width="262" height="523" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 24.</span>—How the Stars are to be seen
in broad Daylight.</div></div>

<p>It is evident that
there are two quite
distinct kinds of motion
of the sun. There is first the daily rising and
setting, for which we have accounted by showing that
it is merely an appearance produced by the fact that
the earth is turning round. But now we have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
considering quite a different motion by which the sun
seems to creep up and down in the heavens, and this
takes a whole year to go through its changes.</p>

<p>There is still another point which we must consider
before we can understand all these puzzling movements
of the sun. We shall ask the stars to help us by their
familiar constellations. You know, perhaps, the Great
Bear, or the Plough as it is often called, and Orion.
There are also Aries the Ram, Taurus the Bull, and
other fancifully named systems. These constellations
have been known for countless ages, and for our present
purposes we may think of them as permanent
groups in the heavens, which do not alter either their
own shapes or their positions relatively to each other.
These groups of stars extend all around the sky. They
are not only over our heads and on all sides down to
the horizon, but if we could dig a deep hole through
the earth, coming out somewhere near New Zealand,
and if we then looked through, we should see that there
was another vault of stars beneath us. We stand on
our comparatively little earth in what seems the centre
of this great universe of stars all around. It is true we
do not often see the stars in broad daylight, but they
are there nevertheless. The blaze of sunlight makes
them invisible. A good telescope will always show the
stars, and even without a telescope they can sometimes
be seen in daylight in rather an odd way. If you can
obtain a glimpse of the blue sky on a fine day from the
bottom of a coal pit, stars are often visible. The top
of the shaft is, however, generally obstructed by the
machinery for hoisting up the coal, but the stars may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
be seen occasionally through the tall chimney attached
to a manufactory when an opportune disuse of the
chimney permits of the observation being made (<a href="#ifig_24">Fig. 24</a>).
The fact is that the long tube has the effect of completely
screening from the eye the direct light of the
sun. The eye thus becomes more sensitive, and the
feeble light from the stars can make its impression, and
produce vision. From all these various lines of reasoning
we see that there can be no doubt of the continuous
presence of stars above and around us, and below us,
on every side, and at all times.</p>

<div id="ifig_25" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_p060.jpg" width="399" height="394" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span>—The Sun seems to revolve around the Earth.</div></div>

<p>If you look out at Christmas time, towards the south,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
you will see the Belt of Orion and the Dog Star in a
splendid portion of the heavens. These stars you will
see every winter in the same place. But you may look
in vain for them in summer. No doubt you can see
stars in the summer evenings, but they will be totally
different from those that adorned the skies in winter.
Each season has its own constellations. This simple
fact was known to the ancients, and we shall find its
explanation full of meaning. Let us select four well-known
constellations which will best answer our purpose.
They lie in a circle round the heavens. They
are Orion, Virgo, Scorpio, and Pisces. I am supposing
that you are looking out at midnight towards the south.
In December you will see Orion; in March, Virgo; in
June, Scorpio; and in September, Pisces; and then
next December you will be looking at Orion again.
See what this proves. At midnight, of course, the sun
is at the other side of the earth, so that if I am looking
at Orion in midwinter the sun must be behind my
back. Look at our little picture (<a href="#ifig_25">Fig. 25</a>). The earth
is in the middle, and the sun must be on the opposite
side to Orion. That is, the sun must be somewhere
about the position I have marked at <span class="smcap smaller">A</span>. In March we
see Virgo in the south at midnight, when, of course,
the sun is at the other side of the earth; so that the
sun must be somewhere at <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>. In June Scorpio is seen,
so that the sun must be at the other side, at <span class="smcap smaller">C</span>. That
is to say, in midsummer the sun is in that part of the
sky where Orion is situated. If, therefore, on a bright
June day we could see the stars, we should find Orion
in the south. But, of course, the light of the sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
makes Orion invisible. We can, however, see the stars
by our telescopes, and on rare occasions an eclipse of
the sun will occur, by which he is temporarily extinguished,
and then we can see the stars without the help
of a telescope, even though it is daytime.</p>

<div id="ifig_26" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_p062.jpg" width="398" height="396" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span>—The Earth, however, really revolves around the Sun.</div></div>

<p>Thus it would seem as if the sun were first at <span class="smcap smaller">A</span>
and then at <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>, <span class="smcap smaller">C</span>, and <span class="smcap smaller">D</span>, and then began to go round
again. I say it would <em>seem</em> as if the sun had these
movements, and the ancients thought there was no
doubt about the matter. Even after it was plain that
the earth turned round on its axis so as to give the
changes of day and night, it was still thought necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
to suppose that the sun went round the earth once in
the year, in order to explain how the changes in the
stars during the different seasons were produced.</p>

<p>Here is another case in which we must be careful to
distinguish between what appears to be true and what
is actually the case. Everything that we undoubtedly
see would be just as well explained by supposing that
the sun remained at rest, and that the earth revolved
around it, as in <a href="#ifig_26">Fig. 26</a>. If, for instance, the earth
were at <span class="smcap smaller">A</span> in midwinter, then the sun is on the opposite
side to Orion, and of course at midnight we shall
be able to see Orion. So in spring the earth is at <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>,
and we see Virgo, and similarly in summer we have
Scorpio, and in autumn Pisces. Thus all that is actually
visible could be fully accounted for by regarding
the sun as fixed in the centre, and the earth as travelling
round it from <span class="smcap smaller">A</span> to <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>, to <span class="smcap smaller">C</span> and to <span class="smcap smaller">D</span> respectively,
and completing the journey in a twelvemonth. Which
idea are we to adopt? Shall we say that the earth goes
round the sun, or the sun goes round the earth?</p>

<p>I remember an old college story, which I cannot help
giving you at this place. It may serve to lighten what
I fear you must otherwise have thought rather a tedious
part of our subject. There were three students brought
up for examination in astronomy, and they showed a
lamentable ignorance of the subject, but the examiner,
being a kind-hearted man, wished, if possible, to pass
them; and so he proposed to the three youths the very
simplest question that he could think of. Accordingly,
addressing the first student, he said: “Now tell me,
does the earth go round the sun, or the sun go round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
the earth?” “It is—the earth—goes round the sun.”
“What do you say?” he inquired, turning rather suddenly
on the next, who gasped out: “Oh, sir—of
course—it is the sun goes round the earth.” “What
do you say?” he shouted at the third unhappy victim.
“Oh, sir, it is—sometimes one way, sir, and sometimes
the other!”</p>

<p>But which is it? Well, we must remember that
the earth is comparatively a very little body and the
sun a very big one, so it is not at all surprising to learn
that the earth goes round the sun, which remains, practically
speaking, at rest in the centre. Thus our great
earth and all it contains are continually bound in what
is very nearly a circular course round the great luminary.
You will find it instructive to work out this
little sum. How fast is the earth moving, or how far
do we go in a second? We are about 93,000,000 miles
from the sun, and the great circle that we go round
has a diameter twice as great as this—that is, about
186,000,000 miles. The circumference of a circle is
nearly three and one-seventh times its diameter, and
accordingly the whole length of the voyage in the year
is about 585,000,000 miles. This has to be accomplished
in 365 days, so that the daily run must be
about 1,600,000 miles. We divide this by 24, to find
the distance journeyed each hour, which we find to be
about 67,000 miles; and we must divide this again by
60 to find the length covered in a minute, and by 60
again for the progress made each second. It is truly
startling to find that, night and day, this great earth
has to travel more than eighteen miles every second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
in order to get round its mighty path in the allotted
time.</p>

<p>I began this lecture about forty minutes ago, and
I think from what I have said you will be able to
calculate a result that will, I dare say, astonish you.
In these forty minutes we have moved about 45,000
miles. No doubt my lecture commenced in this hall,
and in your presence; but can I truly say I began it
<em>here</em>? Well, no; I began it not here, but at a place
45,000 miles away; but we have all been travelling
together, and the journey has been so very smooth
and free from all jolts, that we never thought anything
about the motion.</p>

<p>I am sure many of those to whom I am now
speaking have read accounts of voyages in the Arctic
regions. You have been told of the sufferings of the
crews during the long winters, amid the ice and snow;
and you have heard how, during that dismal period,
there is total darkness, for the sun never rises for
weeks and months together. On the other hand, these
northern regions often present a more cheerful picture.
During midsummer, the long darkness of winter is
atoned for by perpetual sunshine. At midnight there
is still the full brilliance of day, and the sun, though
low, no doubt, has not passed below the horizon. Even
in the northerly parts of Europe we can see the midnight
sun. Lord Dufferin, in his delightful narrative
of a cruise, entitled “Letters from High Latitudes,”
gives an interesting illustration of the perplexities
arising from endless daylight. It appears that everything
went on happily until the fatal moment when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
the yacht crossed the Arctic circle. Then it was that
dire tribulation arose among the poultry. A fine cock
was the cause of the trouble. Knowing his duty, he
always liked to be particular about performing the
important task of crowing at sunrise. This he could
do regularly, so long as the yacht remained in reasonable
latitudes, where the sun behaved properly.
But when they crossed the Arctic circle, the cock was
confronted with a wholly new experience. The sun
never set in the evening, and consequently never had
to rise in the morning. What was the distracted bird
to do? He did everything. He burst into occasional
fits of terrific crowing at all sorts of hours, then he
gave up crowing altogether, but finding that did not
mend matters, he took to crowing incessantly. Exhaustion
was succeeded by delirium, and rather than live
any longer in a universe where the sun was capable of
pranks so heartless, the indignant fowl flung himself
from the vessel and perished in the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<h3>THE CHANGES OF THE SEASONS.</h3>

<div id="ifig_27" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 42em;">
  <img src="images/i_p067.jpg" width="657" height="278" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span>—The Changes of the Seasons.</div></div>

<p>In the adjoining figure, I show a little sketch
(<a href="#ifig_27">Fig. 27</a>), by which I try to explain the changes of
the seasons. It exhibits four positions of the earth,
one on each side of the sun. The left. <span class="smcap smaller">A</span>, represents
the earth when summer gladdens the northern hemisphere;
while the right, <span class="smcap smaller">C</span>, shows winter in the same
region. You will see the two central lines which
represent the axis about which the earth rotates. Of
course, the earth has no visible axis. The line which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
runs through the globe from the North to the South
Pole is imaginary.
It remains fixed in
the earth, for we
can prove in our
observatories that
the Pole does not
shift its position to
any considerable
extent in the earth
itself. In fact, if
we could reach the
North Pole and
drive a peg into
the ground year
after year to mark
the exact spot, we
should find that
the position of the
Pole was sensibly
the same. Does it
not seem strange
that we should be
able to know so
much about the
Pole, though we
have never been
able to get there;
have never, in fact,
been able to get
within less than 400 miles of it? I think you will be able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
to understand the point quite easily. The latitude of a
place, as you know from your geography, is the number
of degrees, and parts of a degree, between that place and
the equator. In our observatories, we can determine
this so accurately that the difference between the latitude
of one side of a room and of the other side of the
same room is quite perceptible. As we find that the
latitudes of our observatories remain sensibly unchanged
from year to year, we are certain that the Pole must
remain in the same place. Indeed, if the Pole were to
alter its position by the distance of a stone’s throw, the
careful watchers in many observatories would speedily
detect the occurrence.</p>

<p>And now I must direct your attention to something
apparently quite different. When the battle of
Waterloo was fought, the great victory was won with
the aid of the old-fashioned musket, a smooth-bore gun
which was loaded at the muzzle with a good charge of
powder, and then a round bullet was rammed down.
“Brown Bess,” as the musket was called, was a most
efficient weapon at close quarters, and indeed at any
distance <em>when the bullet hit</em>; but there was the difficulty.
The round bullets, rushing up the tube and
out into the air in a somewhat vague manner, had a
habit of roaming about, which was quite incompatible
with the accurate shooting of our modern rifles.</p>

<p>One great improvement in small arms consisted in
giving to the bullet a rapid rotation about an axis
which is in the line of fire. This is what the <em>rifle</em>
accomplishes. The grooves in the barrel of the rifle
twist round, and though they only give half a complete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
turn in the length of the barrel, yet the speed of
the bullet is so great that when it flies off it is actually
spinning with the tremendous velocity of about one
hundred and fifty revolutions a second. Even with
the old-fashioned round bullet, the rifling of the barrel
effected great improvement in the accuracy of the
shooting. The introduction of the elongated bullets
was another great improvement, while the adaptation
of breech-loading enabled a bullet to be used rather
larger than that which could have been forced down
the barrel, and thus it was insured that the grooves
should bite into the bullet as it hurries past and
impart the necessary spin.</p>

<p>A body rapidly rotating about an axis has a tendency
to preserve the direction of that axis, and powerfully
resists any attempt to change it. Our earth is
spinning in this fashion. It is true that the rotation
is, in one sense, a slow one, for it requires almost an
entire day for each rotation. But when we remember
the dimensions of our earth, we shall modify this
notion. We have already stated that any place on the
equator has to travel more than one thousand miles
each hour in order to accomplish the journey within
the required time. So far, therefore, the earth moves
like a rifle-bullet, and the direction of its axis remains
constant.</p>

<p>In the course of the great voyage between summer
and winter, the earth travels from one side of the sun
to the opposite side, and in doing so it still continues
to spin about an axis parallel to the original direction.
See the consequences which follow. The sun illuminates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
half the earth, and in the left position in <a href="#ifig_27">Fig. 27</a>,
representing summer, the North Pole is turned over
towards the sun, and lies in the bright half of the earth.
There is continual day at the North Pole, and night is
unknown there at this time of year, because the turning
of the earth about its axis will not bring the Pole
nor the regions near the Pole into the dark hemisphere.
Thus it is that the Arctic regions enjoy perpetual day
at this season. Look now at the position of England
when the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun,
and is consequently enjoying the full splendor of midsummer.
As the earth turns round, England will gradually
cross the boundary between light and shade, and
will enter upon the darkened hemisphere. Then there
will be night in England, but you will see from the
figure that the day is much longer than the night,
and hence it is that we enjoy the fine long days in
summer.</p>

<p>We next look at a different scene six months later.
The earth has reached the other side of the sun, but the
axis has remained parallel to itself, consequently the
North Pole is now inclined entirely away from the sun.
The earth continues to turn round as before, but its
movements do not bring the North Pole or the surrounding
Arctic regions out of the dark hemisphere,
and consequently the night must be unbroken in these
dismal circumstances. The long continuous day which
forms the Polar midsummer is dearly purchased by
the gloom and cold of a winter in which there is no
sun for many weeks in succession. Observe also the
changed circumstances of England. In the course of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
each twenty-four hours it lies much longer in the dark
half of the earth than in the bright, and consequently
there is only a short day succeeded by a long night.</p>

<h3>SUNSHINE AT THE NORTH POLE.</h3>

<p>It is a privilege of astronomers to be able to predict
events that will happen in thousands of years to come,
and to describe things accurately though they never
saw them, and though nobody else has ever seen them
either. No one has ever yet got to the North Pole, but
whenever they do, we are able to tell them much of
what they will see there. We may leave it to Jules
Verne to describe how the journey is to be made, and
how the party are to be kept alive at the North
Pole. I shall give a picture of the changes of the
seasons, and of the appearance in the stars, as seen from
thence.</p>

<p>We shall, therefore, prepare to make observations
from that very particular spot on this earth—the North
Pole. I suppose that eternal ice and snow abide there.
I don’t think it would be a pleasant residence. However,
we shall arrange to arrive on Midsummer Day,
prepared to make a year’s sojourn. The first question
to be settled is the erection of the hut. In a cold
country it is important to give the right aspect, and we
are in the habit of saying that a southerly aspect is the
best and warmest, while the north and the east are suggestive
only of chills and discomfort. But what is a
southerly aspect at the North Pole, or, rather, what is
not a southerly aspect? Whatever way we look from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
the North Pole we are facing due south. There is
no such thing as east or west; every way is the southward
way. This is truly an odd part of the earth.
The only other locality at all resembling it would be
the South Pole, from which all directions would be
north.</p>

<p>The sun would be moving all through the day in a
fashion utterly unlike its behavior in our latitudes.
There would, of course, be no such thing as rising and
setting. The sun would, indeed, at first seem neither
to go any nearer to the horizon nor to rise any higher
above it, but would simply go round and round the sky.
Then it would gradually get lower and lower, moving
round day after day in a sort of spiral, until at last it
would get down so low that it would just graze the
horizon, right round which it would circulate till half
the sun was below, and then until the whole disk had
disappeared. Even though the sun had now vanished,
a twilight glow would for some time be continuous.
It would seem to come from a source moving round and
round below the horizon, then gradually the light would
become fainter and fainter until at last the winter of
utter and continuous blackness had set in. The first
indications of the return of spring would be detected
by a feeble glow near the horizon, which would seem
to move round and round day after day. Then this
glow would pass into a continuous dawn, gradually
increasing until the sun’s edge crept into visibility, and
the great globe would at last begin to climb the heavens
by its continual spiral until midsummer was reached,
when the change would go on again as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
Our first excursion to the country of Star-land has
now been taken, and we have naturally commenced by
studying that sun to which we owe so much. But
we shall have to learn that though our sun is of such
vital importance to us, yet, in magnificence and size, he
has many rivals among the host of stars.</p>

<h3>THE PHASES OF OUR ATTENDANT, THE MOON.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> first day of the week is related to the greatest
body in the heavens—the sun—and accordingly we
call that day Sun-day. The second day of the week is
similarly called after the next most important celestial
body—the moon—and though we do not actually say
Moon-day, we do say Monday, which is very nearly the
same. In French, too, we have <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">lune</i> for moon, and
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Lundi</i> signifies our Monday. The other days of the
week also have names derived from the heavens, but
of these we shall speak hereafter. We are now going
to talk about the moon.</p>

<p>We can divide the objects in this room into two
classes. There are the bright faces in front of me, and
there are the bright electric lights above. The electric
lights give light, and the faces receive it. I can see
both lights and faces; but I see the electric lamps by
the light which they themselves give. I see the faces
by the illumination which they have received from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
electric lights. This is a very simple distinction, but it
is a very important one in Star-land. Among all these
bodies which glitter in the heavens there are some
which shine by their own light, like the lamps. There
are others only brilliant by reflected light, like the faces.
It seems impossible for us to confuse the brightness of
a pleasant face with the beam from a pretty lamp, but
it is often not very easy to distinguish in the heavens
between a body which shines by its own light and a
body which merely shines by some other light reflected
from it. I think many people would make great mistakes
if asked to point out which objects on the sky
were really self-luminous and which objects were merely
lighted up by other bodies. Astronomers themselves
have been sometimes deceived in this way.</p>

<p>The easiest example we can give of bodies so contrasted
is found in the case of the sun and the moon.
Of course, as we have already seen, the sun is the
splendid source of light which it scatters all around.
Some of that light falls on our earth to give us the
glories of the day; some of the sunbeams fall on the
moon, and though the moon has itself no more light
than earth or stones, yet when exposed to a torrent of
sunbeams, she enjoys a day as we do. One side of her
is brilliantly lighted; and this it is which renders our
satellite visible.</p>

<p>Hence we explain the marked contrast between the
sun and the moon. The whole of the sun is always
bright; while half of the moon is always in darkness.
When the bright side of the moon is turned directly
towards us, then, no doubt, we see a complete circle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
and we say the moon is full. On other occasions a
portion only of the bright surface is directed to us, and
thus are produced the beautiful crescents and semicircles
and other phases of the moon.</p>

<div id="ifig_28" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img src="images/i_p076.jpg" width="425" height="195" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span>—To show that the Moon is lighted by Sunbeams.</div></div>

<p>A simple apparatus (illustrated in <a href="#ifig_28">Fig. 28</a>) will
explain their various appearances. The large india-rubber
ball there shown represents the moon, which I
shall illuminate by a beam from the electric light.
The side of the ball turned towards the light is glowing
brilliantly, and from the right side of the room you see
nearly the whole of the bright side. To you the moon
is nearly full. From the centre of the room you see
the moon like a semicircle, and from the left it appears
a thin crescent of light. I alter the position of the
ball with respect to the lamp, and now you see the
phases are quite changed. To those on my left our
mimic moon is now full; to those on my right the
moon is almost new, or is visible with only a slender
crescent. From the centre of the room the quarter
is visible as before. We can also show the same series
of changes by a little contrivance of <a href="#ifig_29">Figs. 29</a> and <a href="#ifig_29">30</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
Thus every phase of the moon (<a href="#ifig_31">Fig. 31</a>), from the
thinnest beautiful crescent of light that you can just
see low in the west after sunset up to the splendor of
the full moon, can be completely accounted for by the
different aspects of a globe, of which one-half is brilliantly
illuminated.</p>

<div id="ifig_29" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img id="ifig_30" src="images/i_p077.jpg" width="424" height="168" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="floatl in2"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span></p></div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="floatr l8"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span></p></div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="floatc">The Phases of the Moon.</p></div></div>

<p>We can now explain a beautiful phenomenon that
you will see when the moon is still quite young. We
fancifully describe the old moon as lying in the new
moon’s arms when we observe the faintly illuminated
portion of the rest of that circle, of which a part is
the brilliant crescent. This can only be explained by
showing how some light has fallen on the shadowed
side; for nothing which is not itself a source of light
can ever become visible unless illuminated by light
from some other body.</p>

<div id="ifig_31" class="figleft" style="max-width: 14em;">
  <img src="images/i_p078.jpg" width="223" height="230" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>—The Changes in the
Moon.</div></div>

<p>Let us suppose that there is a man on the moon who
is looking at the earth. To him the earth will appear
in the same way as the moon appears to us, only very
much larger. At the time of new moon the bright side
of the earth will be turned directly towards him, so that
the man in the moon will see an earth nearly full, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
consequently pouring forth a large flood of light. Think
of the brightest of all the bright moonlight nights you
have ever seen on earth, and then think of a light which
would be produced if you had thirteen moons, all as big
and as bright as our full moon, shining together. How
splendid the night would then be! You would be able
to read a book quite easily!
Well, that is the sort of
illumination which the
lunar man will enjoy under
these circumstances; all
the features of his country
will be brightly lighted up
by the full earth. Of
course, this earth-lighted
side of the moon cannot
be compared in brilliancy
with the sun-lighted side,
but the brightness will
still be perceptible, so that when from the earth we
look at the moon, we see this glow distributed all
over the dark portion; that is, we observe the feebly
lighted globe clasped in the brilliant arms of the crescent.
At a later phase the dark part of the moon
entirely ceases to be visible, and this for a double
reason: firstly, the bright side of the earth is then not
so fully turned to the moon, and therefore the illumination
it receives from earth-shine is not so great; and,
secondly, the increasing size of the sun-lighted part of
the moon has such an augmented glow that the fainter
light is overpowered by contrast. You must remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
that more light does not always increase the number of
things that can be seen. It has sometimes the opposite
effect. Have we not already mentioned how the brightness
of day makes the stars invisible? The moon herself,
seen in full daylight, seems no brighter than a
small particle of white cloud.</p>

<h3>THE SIZE OF THE MOON.</h3>

<p>It is not easy to answer the question which I am
sometimes asked, “Is the moon very big?” I would
meet that question by another, “Is a cat a big animal?”
The fact is, there is no such thing as absolute bigness
or smallness. The cat is no doubt a small animal
when compared with the tiger, but I think a mouse
would probably tell you that the cat was quite a
big animal—rather too big, indeed, in the mouse’s
opinion. And the tiger himself is small compared with
an elephant, while the mouse is large as compared
with a fly.</p>

<p>When we talk of the bigness or the smallness of a
body, we must always consider what we are going to
compare it with. It is natural in speaking of the moon
to compare it with our own globe, and then we can say
that the moon is a small body.</p>

<p>The relative sizes of the earth and the moon may be
illustrated by objects of very much smaller dimensions.
Both a tennis ball and a football are no doubt familiar
objects to everybody. If the earth be represented by
the football, then the moon would be about as large as
the lawn-tennis ball. But this proportion is not quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
accurate, so I will suggest to you an instructive way of
making a better pair of models of the earth and the
moon. In fact, experiments somewhat similar to those
I describe have been actually going on in every kitchen
in the land during this festive season. For have not
globes and balls of all sorts and sizes been made of
plum-pudding, and it will only require a little care on
the part of the cook to make a pair of luscious spheres
that shall fairly set forth the sizes of the earth and the
moon. There is first to be a nice little round plum-pudding,
three inches in diameter. It is just a little
bigger than a cricket ball. It should, however, only
make its appearance at a bachelor’s table. Were it set
down before a hearty circle on Christmas Day, dire disappointment
would result. One boy of sound constitution
could eat it all. Perhaps it would weigh about
three-quarters of a pound. This little globe is to represent
the moon.</p>

<div id="ifig_32" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img src="images/i_p080.jpg" width="435" height="225" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span>—Relative Sizes of the Earth and Moon.</div></div>

<p>Another plum-pudding is to be constructed which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
shall represent the earth (<a href="#ifig_32">Fig. 32</a>). We must, however,
beg the cook to observe the proportions. The width of
the earth, or the diameter, to use the proper word, is
about four times the diameter of the moon. Hence, as
the small plum-pudding was three inches across, the
large one must have a diameter of twelve inches. This
will be a family pudding of truly satisfactory dimensions;
perhaps the cook will be a little surprised to
find the alarming quantity of materials that will be
required to complete a sphere of plum-pudding a foot
in diameter.</p>

<p>These models having been duly made, and boiled,
and placed on the table, we are now to propose the following
<span class="locked">problem:—</span></p>

<p>“If one schoolboy could eat the small plum-pudding,
how many boys would be required to dispose of the
large one?”</p>

<p>The hasty person, who does not reflect, will at once
dash out the answer, “Four!” He will say, “It is
quite plain that, since one of the puddings has four
times the diameter of the other, it must be four times
as big; and therefore, as one boy is able to eat the
small pudding, four boys will be adequate for the large
one.” But the hasty person will, as usual, be quite
wrong. His argument would be sound if it were merely
two pieces of sugar-stick that he was comparing; no
doubt there is only four times as much material in a
piece twelve inches long as there is in a piece three
inches long. But the plum-puddings have breadth and
depth, which are in the same proportions as the length,
and the consequence is that the large plum-pudding is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
far more than four times as big as the small one. No
four boys, however admirable their capacities, would be
equal to the task of consuming it. Nor even if four
more boys were called in to help would the dish be
cleared. Twenty boys, forty boys, fifty boys would not
be enough. It would take sixty-four boys to demolish
the magnificent plum-pudding one foot in diameter.</p>

<p>If the cook will try the experiment, she will find that
by taking the materials sufficient for sixty-four small
plum-puddings all of the same size, and mixing them
together, she will, no doubt, make a large plum-pudding,
but its diameter will only be four times that
of the small puddings.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the moon is 2160 miles in
diameter, and the earth is 7918 miles. These numbers
are so nearly 2000 and 8000 respectively, that for simplicity
I have spoken of the earth as having a diameter
four times as great as the moon. If we want to be very
accurate, we ought to determine the ratio of the two
quantities from the figures just given. Our illustration
of the plum-puddings must, therefore, be a little modified.
The earth is not quite so much as sixty-four
times as big as the moon; but this figure is sufficiently
accurate for our present purpose.</p>

<p>Another interesting question may be proposed,
namely: How much land is there on the moon? We
might state the answer in acres or in square miles;
but it will, perhaps, be more instructive to make a
comparison between the moon and the earth.</p>

<p>Here also I shall use an illustration; and we shall
again consider two globes which are respectively three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
inches and twelve inches in diameter. The globes I
use this time are hollow balls of india-rubber. These
will represent the earth and the moon with sufficient
accuracy, and the relative surfaces of these two globes
is what I want to find. There are different ways in
which the comparison might be made. I might, for
instance, paint the two globes and see the quantity of
paint that each requires. If I did this, I should find
that the great globe took just sixteen times as much
paint as the small one. We can adopt a simpler plan.
The india-rubber in one of these balls has the same
thickness as in the other, as they are each hollow, so
that the quantity which is required for each ball may
be taken to represent its surface. By simply weighing
the two balls, I perceive that the large one is sixteen
times as heavy as the small one. You notice here the
difference between the comparative weights of two hollow
balls and two solid ones of the same material.
Had these globes been of solid india-rubber, the large
one would have weighed sixty-four times as much as
the small one, just as in the case of the plum-puddings;
but being hollow, the ratio of their weights is only the
square of the ratio of their diameters—that is to say,
four times four, or sixteen.</p>

<p>We are thus taught that if the moon were exactly
one-fourth of the diameter of the earth, its surface
would be one-sixteenth part of that of the earth. It
would, no doubt, have made our subject a little easier
and simpler if the moon had been created somewhat
smaller than it is. As, however, the universe has not
been solely constructed for the purpose of these talks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
about Star-land, we must take things as we find them.
This proportion is not four; it is more nearly 3⅔, and
the relative surfaces of the two bodies is the square of
11/3, or about 13½. In other words, the entire extent of
the surface of our globe is about thirteen and a half
times that of the moon.</p>

<p>The face of the full moon, being half the entire extent
of the surface, is, therefore, about one-twenty-seventh
part of the earth’s surface—continents, oceans, seas,
and islands all taken together. The British Empire
and the Russian Empire are each of them as large as
the face of the full moon.</p>

<h3>HOW ECLIPSES ARE PRODUCED.</h3>

<p>The moon is the attendant, or the satellite of the
earth, ministering to the wants of the earth by mitigating
the darkness of our nights. The earth goes around
the sun in its annual journey of 365 days. The moon
revolves around the earth once every twenty-seven
days. The motion of the moon is thus a very complicated
one, for it is, in fact, moving round a body which
is itself in constant motion (<a href="#ifig_33">Fig. 33</a>).</p>

<p>You will see by your almanacs every year that certain
eclipses are to take place; and after what we have said
about the sun and the moon, it will be easy to understand
how eclipses arise. There are two different kinds.
You will sometimes see an eclipse of the moon, and
sometimes those eclipses of the sun of which we have
spoken in the last Lecture. You may be surprised to
find with what accuracy the eclipses can be predicted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
We can tell not only those that will occur this year and
next year, but we could also foretell the eclipses that
will appear in a hundred or a thousand years to come;
or we can, with equal ease, calculate backwards, so as
to find the circumstances of eclipses that happened
thousands of years ago. This shows how well we have
learned the way the moon moves.</p>

<p class="floatc"><span class="smcap">Fig. 35.</span>—Different Kinds of Solar Eclipse.</p></div></div>

<p>An eclipse of the sun is the simpler occurrence, so
we shall describe it first. It happens when the moon
comes between the earth and the sun. Look at our
little astronomers shown in <a href="#ifig_34">Fig. 34</a>. A boy and a girl
are both gazing at the sun, when the moon comes between.
To the boy the moon appears to take a great
bite out of the sun, so that it looks like the left-hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
picture in <a href="#ifig_35">Fig. 35</a>. (I have drawn a line from the end
of the telescope in <a href="#ifig_34">Fig. 34</a>, which shows how much of
the sun is cut off.) This would be called a partial
eclipse of the sun. The almanac will sometimes describe
the eclipses as visible in London, or visible at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
Greenwich; but that need not be taken so literally as
was supposed by a Kensington gentleman, who, on
noticing that the almanac said an eclipse was to be
visible in London, called a cab and drove into the city
to look for it. His almanac had not mentioned that it
would be visible from his own house. You may usually
take for granted that when an eclipse is said to be
visible from London or Greenwich, it will be more or
less visible all over England. Most of these eclipses
are only partial, and though they are interesting to
watch they do not teach us much. By far the most
wonderful kind of eclipse is that in which the whole of
the bright part of the sun is blotted out. Then, indeed,
we do see wonders. But such eclipses are rare, and
even when they do occur they only last a very few minutes.
The sights that are displayed are so interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
that astronomers often travel thousands of miles to
reach a suitable locality for making observations.</p>

<p>The girl in <a href="#ifig_34">Fig. 34</a> is placed in the best possible
position for seeing the eclipse. There you find her
right in the line of the sun and moon; and I think
you will agree that she cannot see any part of the sun,
for the moon is altogether in the way. I have drawn
two dotted lines, one at each side. All that she can
see beyond the moon must lie outside these dotted
lines, and she will be in the dark as long as the moon
stays in the way. When the eclipse is complete, comparative
darkness steals over the land. The birds are
deceived, and fly home to the trees to roost. The owls
and the bats, thinking their time has arrived, venture
forth on their nocturnal business. Even flowers close
their petals, only to open a few minutes later when the
sun again bursts forth. Other flowers that give forth
their fragrance at night are also sweetly perceptible so
long as the sun remains obscured. An unruly cow,
accustomed to break into a meadow at night, was found
there after an eclipse was over; while I learn from the
same authority that a man rushed over in great excitement
to see what his chickens were doing, but came
back much disappointed on finding them pecking away
as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>It will sometimes happen that the moon is so placed
that the edge of the sun can be seen all round it. A
case of the kind is shown in the right-hand picture of
<a href="#ifig_35">Fig. 35</a>. It is called an annular, or ring-shaped eclipse.</p>

<p>The eclipses of which we have been speaking are, of
course, only to be seen during the day when the sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
must be up. The lunar eclipses, which are visible at
night, are due to the interposition of the earth between
the sun and the moon. The sun is at night-time under
our feet at the other side of the earth, and the earth
throws a long shadow upwards. If the moon enter
into this shadow, it is plain that the sunlight is partly
or wholly cut off, and since the moon shines by no light
of her own, but only by light borrowed from the sun,
it follows that when she is buried in the shadow all the
direct light is intercepted, and she must lose her brilliancy.
Thus we obtain what is called a lunar eclipse. It
is total if the moon be entirely in the shadow. The eclipse
is partial if the moon be only partly in the shadow. The
lunar eclipse is visible to everybody on the dark hemisphere
of the earth if the clouds will keep out of the way,
so that usually a great many more people can see a lunar
eclipse than a solar eclipse, which is only visible from a
limited part of the earth. It thus happens that the lunar
eclipse is the more familiar spectacle of the two.</p>

<p>When the moon is entirely in the shadow, one might
naturally think that it would become totally invisible.
This is not always the case. It is a curious fact that
in the depth of a total eclipse the moon is often still
visible, for she glows with a copper-colored light, which
is bright enough to render some of the chief marks on
her surface distinctly discernible.</p>

<h3>EFFECT OF THE MOON’S DISTANCE ON ITS APPEARANCE.</h3>

<p>We are now about to take a good look at the moon
and examine the different objects which are marked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
upon it. There is a peculiar interest attached to this
particular orb, because it is much the nearest of all the
heavenly bodies to our globe, and therefore the one that
we can see the best. Every other object—sun, star,
or planet—is hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of times
as far off as the moon. It is right that we should desire
to learn all we can about the bodies in space. We
know that the earth is a great ball, and we see that
there are many other such bodies. Some of them are
much larger, and some of them are smaller than the
globe on which we dwell; some of them are dark
bodies like the earth, and among them the moon is
one. Is it not reasonable that we should make special
efforts to find out all we can about this interesting
neighbor?</p>

<p>Though the moon is so close to us relatively to other
objects in space, yet when we express its distance in
the ordinary methods of measurement it is a very long
way off—about 240,000 miles—a length nearly as
great as that of all the railways in the world put
together. An express train which runs forty miles an
hour would travel 240 miles in six hours, and the
whole distance to the moon would be accomplished in
6000 hours, so that travelling by night and day incessantly
you would accomplish the journey in 250
days. To take another illustration, if you wrapped a
thread ten times round the equator of the earth, it
would be long enough to stretch from the earth to the
moon. Or suppose a cannon could be made sufficiently
strong to be fired with a report loud enough to be
audible 240,000 miles away. The sound would only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
be heard at that distance a fortnight after the discharge
had taken place.</p>

<p>The moon is too far for us to examine the particular
features on its surface by the unaided eye. Suppose
that there was a mighty city like London on the moon,
with great buildings and teeming millions of people,
and you went out on a fine night to take a look at our
neighbor. What do you think you would be able to
see of the great lunar metropolis? Would you be able
to see its streets full of omnibuses, or even its great
buildings? Would you see St. Paul’s and Westminster—the
great parks and the river? Of all these things
your unaided eye would show you almost nothing. I
can give you a little illustration. Suppose that you
made a tiny model of London; imagine this little
structure all complete, so that the streets, the buildings,
the bridges, the railways, the parks, and the
Thames were placed in their true proportions; suppose
that the miniature city was so small that it could
stand on a penny postage stamp, surely everything
would look very insignificant, even if you had the
model in your hand and looked at it with the aid of
a magnifying glass. But suppose it were put on the
other side of the table or on the other side of the room,
or the other side of the street. Even St. Paul’s Cathedral
itself would have ceased to be distinguishable;
but yet the distance is not nearly great enough. You
would have to put the little model a quarter of a mile
away before it would be in the right position to illustrate
the appearance of a lunar London to the unaided
eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<h3>A TALK ABOUT TELESCOPES.</h3>

<p>The astronomer will not be contented with a mere
naked-eye inspection of a world so interesting as the
moon. He will get a telescope to help his vision.
The word “telescope” means a contrivance for looking
at objects which are a long way off. We have
explained that the further an object is, the smaller it
appears to be. The telescope enables us to largely
overcome this inconvenience. It has the effect of
making a distant object look larger.</p>

<p>There are great differences in the forms of telescopes;
and some instruments are large and some
small, according to the purposes for which they are
required. Perhaps the most useful practical application
of the telescope is by the officer on duty on
board a ship. He is generally provided with a pair
of these instruments bound together to form the
“binocular.”</p>

<p>You are all acquainted with this useful contrivance,
or at all events with the opera-glass, that is used for
purposes with which landsmen are more familiar. The
ship’s telescope, or the binocular, or the opera-glass,
is feeble in power when compared with the great
instruments of the Observatory. The officer on the
ship will generally be satisfied with a telescope which
shall show the objects with which he is concerned
at about one-third of their actual distance. Thus,
suppose his attention is directed to a great steamer
three miles away, he wishes to see her more clearly,
and accordingly he takes a view through his binocular.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
Immediately the vessel is so transformed that it seems
to be only one mile away. The apparent dimensions
of the object are increased threefold. The hull is
three times as long, the masts and the funnel are
three times as high, the sailors are three times as
tall; various objects on the ship too small to be
seen at three miles would be visible from one mile,
and to that apparent distance the ship has now been
brought.</p>

<p>If the sailor desires to reduce the apparent distance
of objects, how much more keenly does the astronomer
feel the same want? At best, the sailor only has to
scan a range of a few miles with his glass, but what
are a few miles to the astronomer? It is true that he
can count the distance of the moon by thousands of
miles, a good many thousands, no doubt, but for all
other objects he must use millions, while for most
bodies in space, millions of millions of miles are the
figures we are constrained to employ. Need it be
said that the astronomer must resort to every device
he can to make the body appear closer. He does
not despise the modest binocular. It is often a useful
instrument in the Observatory. It gives most beautiful
pictures of the celestial scenery, and you would
be amazed to find how many thousands of stars you
can see with its help which your unaided eye would
not show you at all. The binocular will also greatly
improve the appearance of the moon, but still its
powers fall far short of what we require for the
study of lunar landscapes. Even though we can
reduce the moon’s apparent distance to one-third its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
actual amount, yet still that third is a very considerable
distance. One-third of 240,000 is 80,000, so
that we can see the moon no better with a binocular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
than we should see it were it 80,000 miles away, and
were we viewing it with the unaided eye.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 37.</span>—The Equatorial at Dunsink Observatory.</div></div>

<p>I am not going to enter here upon any detailed
account of the telescope, because I shall say a little
more on the subject in a later lecture; at present I
only describe that form of instrument which is most
convenient for studying the moon. I take as an illustration
the South Equatorial at Dunsink Observatory,
which belongs to Trinity College, Dublin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
This telescope has a building to itself, which stands
on the lawn in front of the house. The site is open
and elevated, so as to command an extensive prospect
of the heavens. You will see in <a href="#ifig_36">Fig. 36</a> a picture of
the structure. It is circular in form and is entered
by the little porch. The most peculiar feature of an
edifice intended to contain this kind of telescope is
its roof, or <em>Dome</em>, as we call it. It is of a hemispherical
shape with a projecting rim at the bottom.
But no one would go to the trouble and expense of
making a round dome like that over the Observatory
if it were not necessary for a particular purpose. The
dome is very unlike ordinary roofs, not only in appearance,
but also because it can turn round. In the next
figure you will see a section through the building, and
the wheels are exposed by which the dome is carried.
These wheels run easily on rails, so that when the
attendant pulls the rope which you see in his hands,
he turns round a large pulley, and that operates a little
cogwheel which works into a rack, and thus makes the
dome revolve. The roof is built of timber, covered
with copper; it weighs more than six tons, but the
machinery is so nicely adjusted, that a child four years
old can easily set the whole in motion. The object of
all this machinery is seen when we learn that there is
only one opening in the dome. It is covered by the
shutter shown over the doorway in <a href="#ifig_36">Fig. 36</a>. When
opened to the top, it gives a long and wide aperture,
through which the astronomer can look out at the
heavens. Of course the dome has to be turned until
the opening has been brought to face the required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
aspect. The big telescope can thus be directed to any
object above the horizon. You see a gentleman using
the telescope (<a href="#ifig_37">Fig. 37</a>), and this shows that the great
instrument is nearly three times as long as the astronomer
himself! No doubt the telescope seems to be
composed of a good many different parts, but the
essential portions of the instrument are comparatively
few and simple. At the upper end is the object glass,
which consists of two lenses, one of flint glass and the
other of crown glass. Both of these must be of exceptional
purity, and the shape to be given to the lenses
is a matter of the utmost importance. It is in the
making of this pair of glasses that the skill of the
optician has to be specially put forth. So valuable
indeed is an object glass which fulfils all the requirements,
that it is by far the most costly part of the
instrument. There are no glasses in the interior of
the tube until you come to the end where the observer
is looking in. This is closed by an eyepiece consisting
of a lens, or a pair of lenses. There are usually
many different eyepieces for a telescope, and they
contain lenses of varied powers, to be used according
to the state of the atmosphere, or to the particular
kinds of observation in progress.</p>

<p>If you point a big telescope to the sky, and see
therein the sun or the moon or any of the stars, you
will speedily find that the objects pass away out of
view. Remember our earth is constantly turning
round, and bears, of course, the Observatory with it, so
that though the telescope be rightly pointed to the
heavens at one moment, by the next it will have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
turned aside. To you who are using the telescope, the
appearance produced is as if the heavenly bodies were
themselves moving. We can counteract this inconvenience.
The telescope is supported on a pedestal,
which is built on masonry, that goes down through the
floor to its foundation on the solid rock beneath. In
the iron casing at the top of the pedestal you will see
a little window, and inside is clockwork driven by a
heavy weight. This clockwork turns the whole telescope
round in the opposite direction to that in which
the earth is moving. The consequence is that the
telescope remains constantly pointed to the same part
of the heavens.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 38.</span>—The Yerkes Telescope, University of Chicago.</div></div>

<p>This instrument is no doubt a large one, but of
late years many much greater have been built. The
most powerful telescope that has ever been erected is
the great Yerkes instrument belonging to the University
of Chicago, of which a picture is shown in <a href="#ifig_38">Fig. 38</a>.
The object glass is 40 inches across.</p>

<h3>HOW THE TELESCOPE AIDS US IN VIEWING THE MOON.</h3>

<p>Those who are in charge of an observatory are often
visited by persons who, coming to see the wonders of
the heavens, and finding instruments of such great proportions,
not unnaturally expect the views they are to
obtain of the celestial bodies shall be of corresponding
magnificence. So they are, no doubt, but then it frequently
happens that the pictures which even the greatest
telescope can display will fall far short of the ideal
pictures which the visitors have conjured up in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
own imaginations, so that they are often sadly disappointed.
Especially is this true with regard to the
moon. I have seen people who, when they had a view
of the moon through a great telescope, were surprised
not to find vast ranges of mountains which looked to
them as big as the Alps, or mighty deserts, over which
the eye could roam for thousands of miles. They have
sometimes expected to behold stupendous volcanoes that
not only were, but that looked to be as big as Vesuvius.
Others seem to have thought they ought to see the
moon with such clearness that the fields were to be
quite visible, and some would not have been much
astonished if they had observed houses and farmyards,
and, perhaps, even cocks and hens.</p>

<p>There are different ways of estimating the apparent
dimensions of an object, but the size the moon appears
to me to have in a great telescope may be illustrated
by taking an orange in your hand and looking at the
innumerable little marks and spots on its surface. The
amount of detail that the eye will show on the orange
is about equal to the amount of detail that a good
telescope will show on the moon. A desert on the
moon, which really is a hundred miles across, will
then correspond to a mark about an eighth of an inch
in diameter on the orange. Some of you may ask what
is gained by the use of a telescope, for the moon looks
to us as large as a plate with the unaided eye, and now
we hear it only looks as big as an orange in the telescope.
But where is the plate with which you compare your
moon supposed to be held? It is surely not in your
hand. It is imagined to be up in the sky, a very long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
way off. Though an orange is much smaller than a
plate, yet you will be able to see many more details in
the orange by taking it in your hand than you could
see on a plate which was at the other side of the street.</p>

<div id="ifig_39" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21em;">
  <img src="images/i_p101.jpg" width="322" height="399" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 39.</span>—The Advantage of using a Telescope.</div></div>

<p>I sometimes find that people will not believe how
much the telescope that they are using is magnifying
the moon until they use both eyes together, of which
one is applied to the telescope, while the other is
directed to the moon. It will then be seen, even with a
very small instrument, that the telescopic moon is as big
as the larger of the two crescents in the adjoining figure
(<a href="#ifig_39">Fig. 39</a>), while the naked-eye moon is like the smaller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
The greatest telescopes are capable of reducing the
apparent distance of an object to about one-thousandth
part of its actual amount. If, therefore, a body were
a thousand miles away, it would, when viewed by one
of these mighty instruments, be seen as large as our
unaided vision would show it, were the body only a
single mile distant. No doubt this is a large accession
to our power, but it often falls far short of what the
astronomer would desire. The distances of the stars
are all so great that even when divided by one thousand,
they are still enormous. If you have a number
expressed by 100,000,000,000,000, then dividing it by
a thousand merely means taking off three of the ciphers,
and there is still a large number left. We are, however,
at present concerned with the moon, and, as its distance
is about 240,000 miles, the effect of the best telescope
is to reduce this distance apparently to 240 miles.
Here, then, we find a limit to what the best of all telescopes
can do. It can never show us the moon better
than, hardly indeed so well as, we could see it with our
unaided eye were it only 240 miles over our heads.
We cannot expect the most powerful instruments to
reveal any object on the moon unless that object were
big enough to be seen by the unaided eye when 240
miles away. What could we expect to see at a distance
of 240 miles?</p>

<p>Here is a little experiment which I made to study
this point. I marked a round black dot on a sheet of
white paper. The dot was a quarter of an inch in diameter,
and then I fastened this on a door in the garden,
and walked backwards until the dot ceased to be visible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
I found this distance to be about thirty-six yards. I
tried a little boy of eight years old, and it appeared
that the dot became invisible to him about the same
time as it did to me. “What has this to do with the
moon?” you will say. Well, we shall soon see. In
thirty-six yards there are 5184 quarters of an inch,
and as it is unnecessary to be very particular about the
figures, we may say, in round numbers, that the distance
when we ceased to be able to distinguish the dot was
about five thousand times as great as the width of the
dot itself. You need not, therefore, expect to see anything
on the moon or on anything else which is not at
least as wide as the five-thousandth part of the distance
from which we are viewing it. The great telescope
practically places the moon at a distance of 240 miles,
and the five-thousandth part of that is about eighty
yards; consequently a round object on the moon about
eighty yards in diameter would be just glimpsed as the
merest dot in the most powerful telescope. To attract
attention, a lunar object should be much larger than
this. If St. Paul’s Cathedral stood on a lunar plain,
it would be visible in our great telescopes. It is
true that we could not see any details. We should
not be able to distinguish between a Cathedral and
a Town-hall. There would just be something visible,
so that the artist who was making a sketch of that
part would put down a mark with his pencil to show
that something was there. This will show us that
we need not expect to see objects on the moon, even
with the mightiest of telescopes, unless they are of
great size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<h3>TELESCOPIC VIEWS OF LUNAR SCENERY.</h3>

<p>I have already warned you not to expect too much,
even with the biggest of telescopes; and just as a
caution, I may, perhaps, tell you a story I once heard
of an astronomer who had a great telescope. It was
a very famous instrument, and people often came to
the Observatory at night to enjoy a look at the heavens.
Sometimes these visitors were grave philosophers, but
frequently they were not very accomplished men of
science. One evening such a visitor came to the
Observatory, and sent in his name and an introduction
to the astronomer, with a request that he might enter
the temple of mystery. The astronomer courteously
welcomed the stranger, and asked him what he specially
desired to see.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the visitor, “I have specially come to
see the moon—that is the object I am particularly
interested about.”</p>

<p>“But,” said the astronomer, “my dear sir, I would
show you the moon with pleasure, if you were here at
the proper time; but what brings you here now? Look
up; the evening is fine. There are the stars shining
brightly, but where is the moon? You see it is
not up at present. In fact, it won’t rise till about
half-past two to-morrow morning, and it is only
nine o’clock now. Come back again in five or six
hours, and you shall observe the moon with the great
telescope.”</p>

<p>But the visitor evidently thought the astronomer
was merely trying to get rid of him by a pretext. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
he was equal to the occasion—he was not going to be
put off in that way.</p>

<p>“Of course, the moon is not up,” he replied; “any
one can see that, and that is the reason why I have
come, for <em>if the moon had been up, I could have seen
it without your telescope at all</em>!”</p>

<p>Although no explorer can ever reach our satellite,
yet it is hardly an exaggeration to say that in some
respects we know the geography of the moon a good
deal better than we know the geography of the earth.
Think of the continent of Africa. In that great country
there are mighty tracts, there are vast lakes and ranges
of mountains, of which we know but little. We could
make a better map of Africa, so far at least as its broad
outlines are concerned, if it were fastened up on our
side of the moon than we actually possess at this
moment. There is no spot on the nearer side of the
moon as large as an ordinary parish in this country
which has not been surveyed. There are maps and
charts of the moon showing every part of it, which
is as big as a good-sized field. Indeed, as there are
no lunar clouds, the features of its surface are never
obscured whenever our own atmosphere will permit
us to make our observation. Artists have frequently
sketched the lunar features, and there is plenty of
material for them to work on. We have also had
photographs taken of the moon, but there is a special
difficulty to be encountered in taking photographs of
celestial bodies which photographers of familiar objects
on this earth do not experience. For a photograph to
be successful, everybody knows that the first requisite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
is for the sitter to stay quiet while the plate is being
exposed. This is, unhappily, just what the moon cannot
do. We endeavor to obviate the difficulty by moving
the telescope round so as to follow the moon in its
progress. This can be done with considerable accuracy,
but, unfortunately, there is another difficulty which
lies entirely beyond our control. As the rays of light
from the moon perform their journey through hundreds
of miles of unsteady air, the rays are bent hither and
thither, so that the picture is more affected by the
atmosphere than in the case of a photographer’s portrait
taken in the studio. If we are merely <em>viewing</em> the
moon through the telescope, the quivering effect on the
rays of this long atmospheric voyage, though rather
inconvenient, does not prevent us from seeing the
object, and we can readily detect the true shape of
each feature in spite of incessant fluctuations. When,
however, these rays fall not on the eye, but on the
photographic plate, they produce by their motion a
picture which cannot be much magnified without becoming
very confused and wanting in sharpness.
Nevertheless, for the general outlines of our satellite’s
appearance and for the portraiture of its splendid
features we have derived the greatest assistance from
photography.</p>

  <img src="images/i_p107.jpg" width="449" height="469" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 40.</span>—The Full Moon.</div></div>

<p>The adjoining picture (<a href="#ifig_40">Fig. 40</a>) gives a fair idea
of what the full moon looks like when viewed through
a small telescope. I do not, however, say that the
lunar objects can then be observed under favorable
conditions; for when the moon is full is the very worst
time for making observations of our satellite. In fact,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
at this phase you can hardly see anything except slight
differences between the colors of different parts. The
best time for observing the moon is at the first quarter;
but even then you can only observe satisfactorily those
objects which happen to lie along the border between
light and shade. To study the moon properly you
must, therefore, watch it during several different phases,
from the time when it presents a thin and delicate
crescent (just after new moon) until it has again waned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
to a thin and delicate crescent (just before the next
new moon). We want the relief given by shadows to
bring out the full beauty of lunar scenery.</p>

<p>On the map you will first notice the large dark-colored
patches which are so conspicuous on the
moon’s face. They are, apparently, the empty basins
which great seas once filled. But if water was ever
there it has at all events now quite disappeared.
These dark parts are, no doubt, a good deal smoother
than the rest of the surface; but we can see many
little irregularities which tell us that we are not looking
at oceans. The chief features I want you to
observe are the curious rings which you see in the
figure; there is a very well-marked one a little below
the centre, and in the upper part many rings—large
and small—are crowded together. We call them
lunar craters. You will see what they are like from
the model, of which a picture is shown in <a href="#ifig_42">Fig. 42</a>.
But to realize from this picture the proper scale of
the object, you should imagine it to be some miles
in width. The cliffs which rise all round to form
the wall, as well as the mountain which adorns the
centre, are quite as high as any of the mountains in
Great Britain.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.</span>—Our Model of a Lunar Crater.</div></div>

<p>You may desire to know how we are able to measure
the heights of mountains on the moon. That is what
I am now going to show you; and for this purpose we
shall look at our imitation lunar crater. Here is the
great ring, or circular enclosure, surrounded by cliffs,
and here is a sharp mountain peak rising in the centre.
I shall ask to have the beam from the electric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
lamp turned on our model. You see how prettily
it is lighted up. I have placed the lamp so that the
beams are sloping; and I have done this with the
express object of making the shadows long. In fact,
as we look at a lunar crater, which lies on the border
between light and shade, the sun illuminates the object
under the same conditions as those shown in the figure.
I dare say you have often noticed what long shadows
are cast at sunset. Similar shadows are made to teach
the astronomer the altitudes of the lunar mountains;
for he measures the length of the shadow, and then by
a little calculation he can find the height of the object
by which that shadow has been cast. I shall suppose
that we want to measure the height of a flagstaff
(<a href="#ifig_43">Fig. 43</a>). It is quite possible to do this by merely
measuring the length of the shadow which that flagstaff
casts at noon. It would not be correct to say
that the height of the flagstaff is the length of its
shadow. This will, indeed, be the case if you are
fortunate enough to make your measurement at or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
near London on either the 6th of April or the 5th
of September. On all other days in the year a little
calculation must be made, which I need not now mention,
but which the astronomer, with the aid of his
Nautical Almanac, can do in a very few minutes. In
a similar manner, by measuring the lengths of the
shadows on the moon, and by finding the number of
miles in the shadow, we are able to calculate the
altitudes of the lunar mountains and of the ranges
of cliffs by which the walled plains are surrounded.</p>

<h3>ON THE ORIGIN OF THE LUNAR CRATERS.</h3>

<p>We have now to offer an explanation of the curious
rings which are the most characteristic features on
the moon. To account for them we must look for a
moment at some objects on the earth. You have all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
heard of volcanoes or burning mountains, such as
Vesuvius or Etna, which occasionally break out into
violent eruptions, and send forth great showers of ashes
and torrents of molten lava. In the Sandwich Islands
there is a celebrated volcano called Kilauea. It is like
a vast lake of lava, so hot that it is actually molten,
and glows with heat like red-hot iron. The adventurous
tourist who visits this crater can climb to the
brink of a lofty range of cliffs which surround it, and
gaze down upon the fervid sea beneath. Suppose that
by some great change the internal heat which keeps
this mighty basin glowing were to decline and go out,
the sea of lava would cease to be liquid, and would
ultimately grow hard and cold, and we should then
have an immense flat plain, surrounded by a range of
cliffs. Elsewhere in the Sandwich Islands examples
of extinct craters may be found at the present day.
Those who have studied these interesting localities
point out how such terrestrial craters explain the
ringed plains in the moon. It seems certain that in
ancient days great volcanoes abounded on our satellite,
and the rings were often much larger than those
on the Sandwich Islands, some of them being one
hundred miles or more in diameter. The volcanoes
must long ago have been raging on the moon with a
fury altogether unknown in any active volcanoes which
this earth can now show. We can also surmise how
the lofty mountain peak, which so often rises in the
centre of a lunar ring, has been upheaved. When the
fires had almost subsided, and the floor had grown
nearly cold, one last and expiring effort is made by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
which the congealing surface is burst through at the
centre, and materials are shot forth which remain as
the central mountain to the present day.</p>

<p>I must, however, impress upon you that even our
greatest telescopes never exhibit to us any volcanic
eruptions at present going on in the moon; in fact, it
is most doubtful if any change has been noticed in the
features on its surface since the date of the invention
of the telescope. The volcanoes sculptured the crust
of the moon into the form in which we see it, and that
form our satellite has preserved for ages, of which we
cannot estimate the duration. All the craters and all
the volcanoes in the moon can only be described as
extinct.</p>

<p>It would be interesting for us to compare the present
condition of the volcanoes in the earth with that of the
ringed craters in the moon. The noisy volcanoes on
our globe are those most talked about; we often hear
of Vesuvius being in eruption, and in August, 1883,
there was a terrific eruption at Krakatoa, during which
a large quantity of dust was shot up into the air, to
such a height that it was borne right round the earth,
and produced beautiful sunsets and unwonted sky hues
in almost every country in the world. The explosion
at Krakatoa made the loudest noise that history has
recorded. Fortunately such convulsions of the earth do
not often happen, for, on that occasion, the sea rushed in
on the land, and thousands of lives were lost. There
are said to be one hundred and fifty volcanoes on different
parts of the earth, which are more or less active, but
there are many others in which the fire has gone out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
and which seem to be just as cold and just as extinct
as any volcanoes in the moon. Even in our own islands
there are abundant remains of ancient volcanoes. Masses
of lava are found in many places where now there is no
trace of an active volcano. Perhaps there is no more
remarkable sight in the British Isles than that lofty
rock which is crowned by Edinburgh Castle; it is the
remnant of a former volcano, while Arthur’s Seat, close
by, is another. In the centre of France is the beautiful
district of Auvergne, in which ancient volcanoes abound;
and the lava streams can be traced for miles across the
country. These volcanoes have been extinct for thousands
of years, during which time the lava has become
largely covered with soil and vegetation, and in some
places vineyards are cultivated upon it.</p>

<p>We are now able to contrast the earth with the
moon, in so far as volcanoes are concerned. On the
earth we have some that are active, and a much
greater number that are extinct. On the moon we
find no active volcanoes, for there all are extinct. I
can explain how this difference has arisen, but first let
me show you a simple experiment. My assistant will
kindly bring to me from that furnace two iron balls,
which we placed there before the commencement of
this lecture; there they are, you see, both glowing with
a bright red heat, for at present they are equally hot.
We will place them on these stands, and allow them to
grow cold. One of these balls is a small cannon-ball,
four inches in diameter, while the other is only one inch.
They are in the same proportion as the earth is to the
moon; but look, even while I am speaking the balls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
have ceased to preserve the same temperature, for the
little one has become almost black from loss of its heat,
while the large one still looks nearly as red as it did at
the beginning; this simple experiment will illustrate
the principle that two heated bodies will cool at very
different rates, if their sizes be different, while the other
conditions are the same. The small body will always
cool faster than the large one. They need not be globes
for this experiment; if you put a poker and a knitting
needle into the fire, and leave both there until they are
red-hot, and then put them out into the fender, you will
speedily find that though they were at the same temperature
when drawn from the fire, they do not long
remain so; indeed, the knitting needle has become cold
enough to handle before the poker has ceased to glow.
Our experiments have been made with, no doubt, small
objects only, but the law about which they inform us
will remain true, even for the greatest objects.</p>

<p>Our earth at the present day shows many indications
of being much hotter within than it is on the surface.
The volcanoes themselves are mere outbreaks of incandescent
material from inside. Then there are hot
springs of water at Bath, which gush out from the
earth. There are geysers of hot water in Iceland and
in the Yellowstone Park in America, and in other
places. And there are other indications also, with
which every miner is familiar. Wherever a deep pit is
sunk into the earth, the rocks below are always found
to be warmer than those on the surface, and the deeper
the pit the greater is the heat that is encountered.
Thus, from all over the world we obtain proofs of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
present existence of internal heat. Great as is the
earth, we must still apply the simple common-sense
principles that we use in our everyday life here. Let
me give an illustration. Suppose that a servant came
into the room and placed a jug of water on the table,
and that an hour afterwards you went to the jug of
water and found it to be cold, you would not from that
fact alone be able to infer anything with certainty, as
to whether the water had been warm or cold when it
was brought in. It might have been perfectly cold, as it
is at present, though on the other hand the water might
have been warm at first, and have since cooled down to
the temperature of the room during the hour.</p>

<p>Suppose, however, that when you went to the jug of
water, which had stood on the table for an hour, you
found it tepid, no matter how slightly its temperature
might be above that of the room, do you not see the
inference you would be able to draw? You would
argue in this way: that water has still some heat; it
must, of course, be gradually cooling, and therefore it
was hotter a minute ago than it is now; it was hotter
still two minutes ago, or ten minutes; and must have
been very hot and perhaps boiling when it was brought
in an hour ago.</p>

<p>I want you to apply exactly the same reasoning to
our earth. It is, as I have shown you, still hot and
warm inside. Of course, that heat is gradually becoming
lost; so that the earth will from year to year gradually
cool down, though at an extremely slow rate.
But we must look back into what has happened during
past ages. Just as we inferred that the jug must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
contained very hot water an hour before from the mere
fact that the water was still warm, so we are entitled to
infer, from the fact that the earth still retains some
heat, that it must in ages gone by have been exceedingly
hot. In fact, the further we look back, the hotter
do we see the earth growing, until at last we are constrained
to think of a period, in the excessively remote
past, long ere life began to dawn on this earth, when
even the surface of the earth was hot. Back further
still we see the earth no longer covered with the hard,
the dark, and the cold surface we now find; we are to
think of it in these primitive times as a huge glowing
mass, in which all the substances that now form the
rocks were then incandescent, and even molten material.</p>

<p>There is good reason for knowing that in those early
times the moon also was molten with heat; and thus
our reasoning has led us to think of a period when
there were two great red-hot globes—one of which
had about four times the diameter of the other—starting
on their career of gradually cooling down. Recall
our little experiment with the two cooling globes of
iron; imagine these globes to preserve their relative
proportions, but that one of them was 8000 miles and
the other 2000 miles across. Ages will, no doubt,
elapse ere they part with their heat sufficiently to allow
the surfaces to cool and to consolidate. We may, however,
be sure that the small globe will cool the faster,
that its outside will become hard sooner than will the
surface of the large one, and long after the small globe
has become cold to the centre, the large one may continue
to retain some of its primeval heat. We can thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
readily understand why all the volcanoes on the moon
have ceased—their day is over. It is over because the
moon, being so small, has grown so cold that it no
longer sustains the internal fires which are necessary
for volcanic outbreaks. Our earth, in consequence of
its much greater size, has grown cold more slowly. It
has no doubt lost the high temperature on the exterior,
and its volcanic energy has probably abated from what
it once was. But there is still sufficient power in the
subterranean fires to awaken us occasionally by a Krakatoa,
or to supply Vesuvius with sufficient materials
and vigor for its more frequent outbursts. The argument
shows us that the time will at last come when this
earth shall have parted with so large a proportion of its
heat that it will be no longer able to provide volcanic
phenomena, and then we shall pass into the exhausted
stage which the moon attained ages ago.</p>

<h3>THE MOVEMENTS OF THE MOON.</h3>

<p>Though the moon is going round and round the
earth incessantly, yet it always manages to avoid affording
us a view of what is on the other side. Our satellite
always directs the same face towards the earth, and
we may reasonably conjecture that the other side is
covered, like the side we know, with rings and other
traces of former volcanoes. In this respect the moon
is quite a peculiar object. The other great celestial
bodies, such as the sun or Jupiter, turn round on their
axes, and show us now one side and then the other,
with complete impartiality. The way in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
moon revolves may be illustrated by taking your watch
and chain, and as you hold the chain at the centre making
the watch revolve in a circular path. At every
point of its path the ring of the watch is, of course,
pointed to the centre where the chain is held. If you
imagine your eye placed at the centre, to represent the
earth, the movements of the watch would exemplify the
way the moon turns round it.</p>

<p>One more point I must explain about the moon before
we close this lecture. There is nothing more familiar
than the fact that a heavy body will fall to the ground.
Indeed, it hardly matters what the material of the body
may be, for you see I have a small iron ball in one hand
and I hold a cork in the other. I drop them at the
same moment, and they reach the ground together.
Perhaps you would have expected that the cork would
have lagged behind the iron. I try the experiment
again and again, and you can see no difference in the
times of their falling, though I do not say this would be
true if they were dropped from the top of the Monument.
In general we may say that bodies let drop will fall sixteen
feet in the first second. Even a bit of paper and
a penny piece will fall through the same height in
the same time if you can get over the difficulty of the
resistance of the air. This is easily managed. Cut a
small piece of tissue paper which will lie flat on the top
of the penny, and hold the penny horizontal with the
paper uppermost. Though there is nothing to fasten
the paper to the penny, you will find that they fall
together. If we could conduct the experiment of dropping
the penny and the bit of paper in a vacuum, then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
whether the paper was laid on the penny or placed in
any other way, the two objects would reach the table at
the same moment if released at the same moment at equal
heights.</p>

<p>Wherever we go we find that bodies will always
tend to fall in towards the centre of the earth; thus in
New Zealand, at the opposite side of our globe from
where we are now standing, bodies will fall up towards
us, and this law of falling is obeyed at the top of a
mountain as it is down here. No matter how high
may be the ascent made in a balloon, a body released
will fall towards the earth’s centre. Of course, we can
only ascend some five or six miles high, even in the
most buoyant of balloons; but we know that the attraction
by which bodies are pulled downwards towards the
earth extends far beyond this limit. If we could go
ten, twenty, or fifty miles up, we should still find that
the earth tried to pull us down. Nor, even if you could
imagine an ascent made to the height of 1000 miles,
would gravitation have ceased. A cork or an iron ball,
or any other object dropped from the height of 1000
miles, would assuredly tumble down on the ground
below.</p>

<p>Suppose that by some device we were able to soar
aloft to a height of 4000 miles. I name that elevation
because we should then be as high above the earth as
the centre of the earth is below our feet. We should
have doubled our distance from the centre of the earth,
and the intensity of the gravitation would have decreased
to one-quarter of what it is at the surface. A body
which at the earth’s surface falls sixteen feet in a second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
would there fall only four feet in a second, and the
apparent weight of any body would be so much reduced
that it would seem to weigh only a quarter of what it
weighs down here. Thus, the higher and higher we
go, the less and less does gravity become; but it does
not cease, even at a distance of millions of miles.
Therefore you might say that as gravity tries to pull
everything down, wherever it may be, why does it not
pull down the moon? This is a difficulty which we
must carefully consider. Supposing that the earth and
the moon were simply held apart, both being at rest,
and that then the moon were to be let go, it would no
doubt drop down directly on the earth. The movement
of the moon would, however, be very different if, instead
of being merely let fall, it was thrown sideways. The
effect of the earth’s pull upon the moon would then be
shown in keeping the moon revolving around us instead
of allowing it to fly away altogether, as it would have
done had the earth not been there to attract it.</p>

<div id="ifig_44" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img src="images/i_p122.jpg" width="427" height="424" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span>—An Illustration to explain the Movement of the Moon</div></div>

<p>We can explain this by an illustration. On the top
of a mountain I have placed a big cannon (<a href="#ifig_44">Fig. 44</a>).
We fire off the cannon, and the bullet flies away in a
curved path, with a gradual descent until it falls to the
ground. I have made the mountain look hundreds of
times larger than any mountain could possibly be; and
now I want you to imagine a cannon far stronger and
gunpowder more potent than any powder or cannon
that has ever yet been manufactured. Fire off a bullet
with a still greater charge than the last time, and now
the path is a much longer one, but still the bullet curves
down so as ultimately to fall on the earth. But make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
now one final shot with a charge sufficiently powerful,
and away flies the bullet, following this time the curvature
of the earth, for the earth’s attraction has the effect
of bending the path of the bullet from a straight line
into this circular form. By the time the bullet has
travelled a quarter of the way round, it is no nearer to
the earth than it was at first, nor has it parted with any
of its original speed. Thus, notwithstanding its long
journey, the bullet has practically just as much energy
as when it first left the muzzle of the cannon. Away
it will fly round another quarter of the earth, and still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
in the same condition it will accomplish the third and
the fourth quarters, thus returning to the point from
which it started. If we have cleared the cannon out of
the way, the bullet will fly again over the mountain
top without having lost any of its speed by its voyage
round the earth. Therefore it will be in a condition to
start again, and thus to revolve around the earth permanently.
If, then, from the top of a mountain 240,000
miles high a great bullet 2000 miles in diameter had
once been projected with the proper velocity, that bullet
would continue forever to circle round and round
the earth, and even though the mountain and the
cannon disappeared, the motion would be preserved
indefinitely. This illustration will, at all events, show
how a continuous revolution of the moon round the
earth can exist, notwithstanding that the earth is constantly
pulling our satellite down towards its surface.</p>

<h3>ON THE POSSIBILITY OF LIFE IN THE MOON.</h3>

<p>Astronomers are often asked whether any animals
can be living on the moon. No observations we can
make with the telescope can answer that question
directly. There are great plains to be seen on the
moon, of course, but even if there were elephants tramping
over those plains, our telescopes could not show
them. Nor will our instruments pronounce at once
whether plants or trees flourish on the moon. The
mammoth trees of California are so big that a tunnel
has been cut through the trunk of one large enough to
give passage for a carriage and pair. Even if there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
were trees as big as this on the moon, they would not
be visible from the most famous observatories.</p>

<p>Let us think what we should ourselves experience if
we could in some marvellous manner be transferred
from the earth to its satellite, and tried to explore that
new and wonderful country. Alas, we should find it
utterly impossible to live there for an hour, or even for
a minute! Troops of difficulties would immediately
beset us. The very first would be the want of air.
Ponder for a moment on the invariable presence of air
around our own globe. Even if you climb to the top
of a high mountain, or if you take a lofty voyage in a
balloon, you are all the time bathed in air. It is air
which supports the balloon, just as a cork is buoyed up
by water. In all circumstances, we must have air to
breathe. In that air is oxygen gas, and we must have
oxygen incessantly supplied to our lungs to reinvigorate
our blood. We require, too, that this oxygen shall be
diluted with a much larger amount of nitrogen gas, for
our lungs and system of circulation are adapted for
abode in that particular mixture of gases which we find
here. The atmosphere becomes more and more rarefied
the higher we ascend, and apparently terminates altogether
some two or three hundred miles over our heads.
Beyond the limits of the atmosphere it seems as if empty
space would be met with all the way from the earth to
the moon. We could not procure a single breath of
air, and life would be, of course, impossible. Even at
a height of three or four miles, respiration becomes
difficult, and doubtless life could not possibly be sustained
at a height of ten miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
It is therefore plain that for a voyage to the moon
we should require an ample supply of air, or, at least,
of life-giving oxygen, which in some way or other was
to be inhaled during the progress of the journey. When
at length 240,000 miles had been traversed, and we
were about to land on the moon, we would first of all
ascertain whether it was surrounded with a coating of
air. Most of the globes through space are, so far as
we can learn, covered and warmed with an enveloping
atmosphere of some kind; but, unhappily, the poor
moon has been left entirely, or almost entirely, without
any such clothing. She is quite bare of atmosphere at
all comparable in density or in volume to that which
surrounds us, though possibly we do now and then perceive
some traces of air, or of some kind of gas, in small
quantities in the lunar valleys.</p>

<p>I am sure each intelligent boy or girl will want to
know how we are able to tell all this. We have never
been at the moon, and how then can we say that it is
nearly destitute of air? Nor can our telescope answer
this question immediately, for you could hardly expect
to see air, even if it were there. How then are we able
to make such assertions? There are many different
ways in which we have learned the absence of air from
the moon. I will tell you one of the easiest and the
most certain of these methods. First let me say that
air is not perfectly transparent. No doubt I can see
you, and you can see me, though a good many feet of
air may lie between us; but when we deal with distances
much greater, there is a very simple way in which
we can show that air is not quite transparent. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
evening, when the sun is setting and the sky is clear,
you can look at him without discomfort; but in the
middle of the day you know that it is impossible to look
at the sun without shading your eyes with smoked glass
or protecting them by some similar contrivance. The
reason is, that when the sun is either setting or rising
we look at it through an immense thickness of air,
which not being perfectly transparent stops some of the
light. Thus it is that the sun in these circumstances
loses its dazzling brilliancy, and we can view it without
discomfort.</p>

<p>At the seaside you can notice the same effect in a
different manner. Go out on a fine and clear night,
when the stars in their thousands are glittering overhead,
and then look down gradually towards the horizon,
and you will find the stars becoming fainter and
fainter. Indeed, even the brightest star cannot be
seen when it is at the horizon, because an immense
thickness of the atmosphere is not transparent.</p>

<p>We can now state the argument by which we may
prove that there is little or no air on our satellite.
The moon will frequently pass between the earth and a
star, and when the star is a really bright one the observations
that can be made are of great interest. Let me
first describe what we actually see. The star is shining
brightly until the moment when the moon eclipses it.
Generally speaking, its disappearance is instantaneous.
But this would not be the case if the moon were encircled
with an atmosphere. If the moon were coated
with air, the light from the star would not be extinguished
<em>instantly</em>; it would gradually decline, according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
as it had to pass through more and more of the
moon’s atmosphere. Thus you would find that the star
dwindled down in brightness before the solid body of
the moon had advanced far enough to shut it out. The
sudden extinction of the stars demonstrates the airless
state of our satellite.</p>

<p>There would be another insuperable difficulty in
adopting the moon as a residence, even supposing that
you could get there. Water is absent from its surface.
We have examined every part of it, and we find no evidences
of seas or of oceans, of lakes or rivers; we never
see anything like clouds or mists, which are, of course,
only water in the vaporous form. We are, therefore,
assured that, so far as water is concerned, the moon is
an absolute desert. This is, perhaps, the most striking
contrast between the aspect of the earth and the aspect
of the moon. Were an astronomer on the moon to look
at our earth he would find most of its surface concealed
beneath clouds, and through the openings in these
clouds he would see that by far the greater part of this
globe was covered by the expanse of ocean; in fact,
when the lunar astronomer had realized the prevalence
of water upon this earth, either in the form of ocean or
cloud, I feel sure he would come to the conclusion that
nothing could live here except seals or other amphibious
animals.</p>

<p>Owing to the absence of air and water, the moon
would be totally disqualified for the support of life of
those types in which we know it. For air and water are
necessary to every animal, from the humblest animalcule
up to whales or elephants. Air and water are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
necessary for every form of vegetable life, from the
lichen which grows on a stone up to the noble old oak
of the forest. But even supposing that we could land
on the moon, bearing with us an ample supply of
oxygen to breathe, and of water to drink, we should
find ourselves perplexed and embarrassed, to say the
very least of it, by an extraordinary difference that
would immediately attract our notice. That familiar
experience of gravity, or the weights of things, which
we have acquired in our residence on a great globe like
the earth, would seem ludicrously altered when we
began to walk about on a little globe like the moon.
We should be astonished at the transformation by
which the weight of everything was much lessened;
when you pulled out your watch you would hardly feel
it at the end of the chain; it would seem like a mere
shell; but yet the watch is all right, it is going as well
as ever. Nothing has altered about it except its weight.
A big stone attracts your notice, and, to your amazement,
you find that it does not weigh so much as a
piece of wood of the same size would weigh down here.
A stone that you could hardly stir on the earth, you
can carry about on the moon. Nor is this to be explained
by any peculiarity in the constitution of the
lunar stone. Most probably it will be not very dissimilar
to some of the rocks on the earth. The relative
lightness of a lunar stone is not due to its being formed
of some very special material; we must seek for some
other explanation. Every object on the moon would
be found only one-sixth as heavy as the same object on
the earth. A sturdy laborer at one of the docks can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
carry one sack of corn on his back here, and he finds
that this load is as much as is convenient. He would,
however, discover, were he placed on the moon, that his
load had suddenly become lightened to one-sixth part
(<a href="#ifig_45">Fig. 45</a>). The laborer would find that he could carry
six sacks of corn on the moon without making a greater
effort than the support of a single sack on the earth
cost him. To explain how such a change as this has
occurred, look at these two pictures: one shows the
laborer on a small body like the moon, the other shows
him on a great globe like the earth. What the laborer
actually does feel is not quite so simple a thing as he
imagines. He imagines that it is the weight of the
corn, and the corn alone, which produces that pressure
on his shoulders which he knows so well. But that is
not exactly the manner in which the philosopher will
look at the same question. What the laborer does
actually feel is the attraction between the earth beneath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
his feet and the corn on his back. It is this force
which produces the pressure on his shoulders. Its
magnitude no doubt depends upon the quantity of corn
in the sack, but it also depends on the quantity of matter
on the earth beneath his feet. In fact, the force
between two attracting bodies depends upon the masses
of both the attracting bodies. When the laborer is
transferred to the moon, of which the mass is so much
less than that of the earth, the attraction is less there
than it is here, even though the corn is the same in the
two cases.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 45.</span>—The Lessened Gravitation on the Moon.</div></div>

<p>Many odd instances could be given of the extraordinary
consequences of life on a world where all weights
are reduced to a sixth part. One occurred to me the
other day when I saw a postman going his rounds with
an amazing load of Christmas presents and parcels. I
thought, how much happier must be the lot of a postman
on the moon, if such functionaries are wanted
there! All the presents of toys or more substantial
donations might be the same as before, the only alteration
would be that they would not feel nearly so heavy.
A box which contains a pound of chocolate bonbons
might still contain exactly the same quantity of sweetmeat
on the moon, but the exertion of carrying it
would be reduced to one-sixth. It would only weigh
as much as two or three ounces do on the earth. Our
streets provide another admirable illustration of the
drawbacks of our life here as compared with the facilities
offered by life on the moon. I feel quite confident
that no perambulators can be necessary there. I cannot
indeed say that there are babies to be found on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
moon, but of this I am certain, that even if the lunar
babies were as plump and as sturdy as ours, they must
still only weigh about a sixth as much as ours do. A
lunar nurse would scorn to use a perambulator, even
for a pair of twins; she might take them both out on
her arm for an airing, and even then only bear one-third
of the load that her terrestrial sister must sustain if she
is carrying but a single child.</p>

<p>The lightness of bodies in the moon would entirely
transform many of our most familiar games. In
cricket, for instance, I don’t think the bowling would
be so much affected, but the hits on the moon would be
truly terrific. I believe an exceptionally good throw of
the cricket-ball here is about a hundred yards, but the
same man, using the same ball and applying the same
force to it, would send the ball six hundred yards on
the moon. So, too, every hit would in the lunar game
carry the ball to six times the distance it does here.
Football would show a striking development in lunar
play; a good kick would not only send the ball over
the cross-bar, but it would go soaring over the houses,
and perhaps drop in the next parish.</p>

<p>Our own bodies would, of course, participate in the
general buoyancy, so that, while muscular power remained
unabated, we should be almost able to run and
jump as if we had on the famous seven-league boots.
I have seen an athlete in a circus jump over ten horses
placed side by side. The same athlete, making the
same effort, would jump over sixty horses on the moon.</p>

<p>A run with a pack of lunar foxhounds would indeed
be a marvellous spectacle. There need be no looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
round by timid horsemen to find open roads or easy
gaps. The five-barred gate itself would be utterly
despised by a huntsman who could easily clear a hay-rick.
It would hardly be worth taking a serious jump
to clear a canal unless there was a road and a railway
or so, which could be disposed of at the same time.</p>

<p>To illustrate this subject of gravitation in another
way, suppose that we were to be transferred from this
earth to some globe much greater than the earth—to
a globe, for instance, as large and massive as the sun.
We can then show that the weight of every object
would be increased. Indeed, everything would weigh
about twenty-seven times as much as we find it does
here. To pull out your watch would be to hoist a
weight of about five or six pounds out of your pocket.
Indeed, I do not see how you could draw out your
watch, for even to raise your arm would be impossible;
it would feel heavier by far than if it were made of
solid lead. It is, perhaps, conceivable that you might
stand upright for a moment, particularly if you had a
wall to lean up against; but of this I feel certain, that
if you once got down on the ground, it would be utterly
out of your power to rise again.</p>

<p>These illustrations will at least answer one purpose:
they will show how difficult it is for us to form any
opinion as to the presence or the absence of life on the
other globes in space. We are just adapted in every
way for a residence on this particular earth of a particular
size and climate, and with atmosphere of a particular
composition. Within certain slender limits our
vital powers can become accommodated to change, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
the conditions of other worlds seem to be so utterly
different from those we find here, that it would probably
be quite impossible for beings constituted as we are
to remain alive for five minutes on any other globe
in space.</p>

<p>It is, however, quite another question as to whether
there may not be inhabitants of some kind on many of
the other splendid globes. We have through the wide
extent of space inconceivable myriads of worlds, presenting,
no doubt, every variety of size and climate, of
atmosphere and soil. It seems quite preposterous to
imagine that among all these globes ours alone should
be the abode of life. The most reasonable conclusion
for us to come to is that these bodies may be endowed
with life of types which are just as appropriate to the
physical conditions around them as is the life, both
animal and vegetable, on this globe to the special circumstances
in which it is placed.</p>

<h3>MERCURY, VENUS, AND MARS.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">We</span> can hardly think of either the sun or the moon
as a world in the sense in which our earth is a world,
but there are some bodies called planets which seem
more like worlds, and it is about them that we are now
going to talk. Besides our Earth there are seven
planets of considerable size, and a whole host of insignificant
little ones. These planets are like ours in a
good many respects. One of them, Venus, is about
the same size as this earth; but the two others, Mercury
and Mars, are very much smaller. There are also some
planets very much larger than any of these, namely,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. We shall in
this lecture chiefly discuss three bodies, namely, Mercury,
Venus, and Mars, which, with the earth, form
the group of “inner” planets.</p>

<p>The planets are all members of the great family
dependent on the sun. Venus and the earth may be
considered the pair of twins, alike in size and weight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
Mercury and Mars are the babies of the system. The
big brothers are Jupiter and Saturn. All the planets
revolve round the sun, and derive their light and their
heat from his beams. We should like to get a little
closer to some of our fellow-planets and learn their
actual geography. Unfortunately, even under the most
favorable circumstances, they are a very long way off.
They are many millions of miles distant, and are always
at least a hundred times as far as the moon. But far
as the planets may be, astronomers have been familiar
with their existence for ages past. I can give you a
curious proof of this. You remember how we said the
first and the second days of the week were called after
the sun and the moon, Sun-day and Moon-day, or Monday,
respectively. Let us see about the other days.
Tuesday is not quite so obvious, but translate it into
French and we have at once <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mardi</i>; this word means
nothing but Mars’ day, and our Tuesday means exactly
the same. Wednesday is also readily interpreted by
the French word <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mercredi</i>, or Mercury’s day, while
Venus corresponds to Friday. Jupiter’s day is Thursday,
while Saturn’s day is naturally Saturday. The
familiar names of the days of the week are thus associated
with the seven moving celestial bodies which
have been known for uncounted ages.</p>

<h3>HOW TO MAKE A DRAWING OF OUR SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>I want every one who reads this book to make a little
drawing of the sun and the planets. The apparatus
that you will need is a pair of compasses; any sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
compasses that will carry a bit of pencil will do. You
must also get a little scale that has inches and parts of
inches divided upon it; any carpenter’s rule will answer.
The drawing is intended to give a notion of the true
sizes and positions of the fine family of which the earth
is one member. The figure I have given (<a href="#ifig_46">Fig. 46</a>) is not
on so large a scale as that which I ask you to use, and
which I shall here mention. Try and do the work neatly,
and then pin up your little drawings where you will be
able to see them every day until you are quite familiar
with the notion of what we mean by our solar system.</p>

<div id="ifig_46" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_p136.jpg" width="395" height="413" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 46.</span>—The Orbits of the Four Inner Planets.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
First open the compasses one inch, and then describe
a circle, and mark a dot on this as “<span class="smcap">Mercury</span>,” in neat
letters, and also write on the circle “88 days.” At the
centre you are to show the “<span class="smcap">Sun</span>.” This circle gives
the track followed by Mercury in its journey round the
sun in the period of 88 days. Next open your compasses
to 1¾ in., which you must do accurately by the
scale. The circle drawn with this radius shows the
relative size of the path of Venus, and to indicate
the periodic time, you should mark it, “225 days.” The
next circle you have to draw is a very interesting one.
The compass is to be opened 2½ in. this time, and the
path that it makes is to be marked “365 days.” This
shows the high road along which we ourselves journey
every year, along which we are, indeed, journeying at
this moment. If you wanted to obtain from your figure
any notions of the true dimensions of the system, the
path of the earth will be the most convenient means of
doing so. The earth is 93,000,000 miles from the sun,
and our drawing shows its orbit as a circle of 2½ in.
radius. It follows that each inch on our little scale
will correspond to about 37,000,000 miles. As, therefore,
the radius of the orbit of Mercury has been taken
to be one inch, it follows that the distance of Mercury
from the sun is about 37,000,000 miles.</p>

<p>We have, however, still one more circle to draw
before we complete this little sketch. The compass
must now open to four inches, and a circle which
represents the orbit of Mars is then to be drawn. We
mark on this “687 days,” and the inner part of the
solar system is then fully represented. You see, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
diagram shows how our earth is in every sense a planet.
It happens that one of the four planets revolves outside
the earth’s path, while there are two inside. By
marking the days on the circles which show the periods
of the planets, you perceive that the further a planet
is from the sun, the longer is the time that it takes to
go round. Perhaps you will not be surprised at this,
for the length of the journey is, of course, greater in
the greater orbits; but this consideration will not
entirely explain the augmentation of the time of revolution.
The further a planet is from the sun, the more
slowly does it actually move, and therefore, for a double
reason, the larger orbit will take a longer time. From
London to Brighton is a much longer journey than from
London to Greenwich, and, therefore, the journey by
rail to Brighton will, of course, be a longer one than
by rail to Greenwich. But suppose that you compared
the railway journey to Greenwich with the journey,
not by rail, but by coach, to Brighton, here the comparative
slowness of the coach would form another
reason besides the greater length of the journey for
making the Brighton trip a much more tedious one than
that to Greenwich. Mars may be likened to the coach
which has to go all the way to Brighton, while Mercury
may be likened to the train which flies along over the
very short journey to Greenwich.</p>

<div id="ifig_47" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 31em;">
  <img src="images/i_p139.jpg" width="486" height="590" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 47.</span>—Comparative Sizes of the Planets.</div></div>

<p>We can easily show from our little sketch that
Mercury must be moving more quickly than Mars, for
the radii of the two circles are respectively one inch
and four inches, and therefore the path of Mars must
be four times as long as the orbit of Mercury. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
Mars moved as fast as Mercury, he would, of course,
require only four times as many days to complete his
large path as Mercury takes for his small path; but
four times 88 is 352, and, consequently, Mars ought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
get round in 352 days if he moved as fast as Mercury
does. As a matter of fact, Mars requires nearly twice
that number of days;
indeed, no less than
687, and hence we
infer that the average
speed of Mars
cannot be much
more than half that
of Mercury.</p>

<div id="ifig_48" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 34em;">
  <img src="images/i_p140.jpg" width="529" height="256" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 48.</span>—Phases of an Inferior Planet.</div></div>

<p>To appreciate
duly the position of
the earth with regard
to its brothers
and sisters in the
sun’s family it will
be necessary to use
your compasses in
drawing another
little sketch, by
which the sizes of
the four bodies
themselves shall be
fairly represented.
Remember that the
last drawing showed
nothing whatever about the sizes of the bodies; it merely
exhibited the dimensions of the paths in which they
moved. As Mercury is the smallest globe of the four, we
shall open the compasses half an inch and describe a
circle to represent it. The earth and Venus are so nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
the same size (though the earth is a trifle the larger)
that it is not necessary to attempt to exhibit the
difference between them, so we shall represent both
bodies by circles, each 1¼ inches in radius. Mars, like
Mercury, is one of the globes smaller than the earth,
and the circle that represents it will have a radius of
¾ of an inch. You should draw these figures neatly,
and by a little shading make them look like globes.
It would be better still if you were to make actual
models, taking care, of course, to give each of them
the exact size. A comparative view of the principal
planets is shown in <a href="#ifig_47">Fig. 47</a>.</p>

<h3>THE PLANET MERCURY.</h3>

<p>Quicksilver is a bright and pretty metal, and, unlike
every other metal, it is a liquid under ordinary circumstances.
If you spill quicksilver, it is a difficult task to
gather the liquid up again. It breaks into little drops,
and you cannot easily lift them with your fingers; they
slip away and escape your grasp. Quicksilver will run
easily through a hole so small that water would hardly
pass, and it is so heavy that an iron nail or a bunch
of keys will float upon it. Now, this heavy, bright,
nimble metal is known by another name besides quicksilver;
a chemist would call it mercury, and the astronomers
use exactly the same word to denote a pretty,
bright, nimble, and heavy planet which seems to try to
elude our vision. Though Mercury is so hard to see,
yet it was discovered so long ago, that all record is lost
of who the discoverer was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
You must take special pains if you want to see
the planet Mercury, for during the greater part of
the year it is not to be seen at all. Every now and
then a glimpse is to be had, but you must be on the
alert to look out just after sunset, or you must be up
very early in the morning so as to see it just before
sunrise. Mercury is always found to be in attendance
on the sun, so that you must search for him near the
sun; that is, low down in the west in the evenings, or
low down in the east in the mornings. To ascertain
the proper time of the year at which to look for him
you must refer to the almanac.</p>

<p>We have seen how Mercury revolves in a path inside
that of Venus, and it is therefore nearer to the sun.
Indeed, Mercury is so close to the sun that it is
generally overpowered by his brilliance and cannot be
seen at all. Like every other planet, Mercury is
lighted by the sun’s rays, and shows phases in the
telescope just as the moon does (<a href="#ifig_48">Fig. 48</a>). In this
figure the different apparent sizes of the planet at
different parts of its path are shown. Of course the
nearer Mercury is to the earth the larger does it
seem.</p>

<p>If we can only see Mercury so rarely, and if even
then it is a very long way off, does it not seem strange
that we can tell how heavy it is? Even if we had a
pair of scales big enough to hold a planet, what, it
may be asked, would be the use of the scales when
the body to be weighed was about a hundred millions
of miles away? Of course the weighing of a planet
must be conducted in some manner totally different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
from the kind of weighing that we ordinarily use.
Astronomers have, however, various methods for weighing
these big globes, even though they can never touch
them. We do not, of course, want to know how many
pounds, or how many millions of tons they contain;
there is but little use in trying to express the weight
in that way. It gives no conception of a planet’s
true importance. One world must be compared with
another world, and we therefore estimate the weights
of the other worlds by comparing them with that of
our own. We accordingly have to consider Mercury
placed beside the earth, and to see which of the two
bodies is the bigger and the heavier, or what is the
proportion between them. It so happens that Mercury,
viewed as a world, is a very small body. It is a good
deal less in size than our earth, and it is not nearly
so massive. To show you how we found out the
mass of Mercury I shall venture on a little story. It
will explain one of the strange devices that astronomers
have to use when they want to weigh a distant body
in space.</p>

<p>There was once, and there is still, a little comet
which flits about the sky; we shall call it after the
name of its discoverer, Encke. There are sometimes
splendid comets which everybody can see—we will
talk about these afterwards—but Encke is not such
a one. It is very faint and delicate, but astronomers
are interested in it, and they always look out for it
with their telescopes; indeed, they could not see the
poor little thing without them. Encke goes for long
journeys through space—so far that it becomes quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
invisible, and remains out of sight for two or three
years. All this time it is tearing along at a tremendous
speed. If you were to take a ride on the comet, it
would whirl you along far more swiftly than if you
were sitting on a cannon-ball. When the comet has
reached the end of its journey, then it turns round and
returns by a different road, until at last it comes near
enough to show itself. Astronomers give it all the
welcome they can, but it won’t remain; sometimes it
will hardly stay long enough for us to observe that it
has come at all, and sometimes it is so thin and worn
after all its wanderings that we are hardly able to see
it. The comet never takes any rest; even during its
brief visit to us it is scampering along all the time, and
then again it darts off, gradually to sink into the depths
of space, whither even our best telescopes cannot follow
it. No more is there to be seen of Encke for another
three years, when again it will come back for a while.
Encke is like the cuckoo, which only comes for a brief
visit every spring, and even then is often not heard by
many who dearly love his welcome note; but Encke is
a greater stranger than the cuckoo, for the comet never
repeats his visit of a few weeks more than once in three
years; and he is then so shy that usually very few
catch a glimpse of him.</p>

<p>An astronomer and a mathematician were great
friends, and they used to help each other in their
work. The astronomer watched Encke’s comet, noted
exactly where it was, on each night it was visible, and
then told the mathematician all he had seen. Provided
with this information the mathematician sharpens his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
pencil, sits down at his desk, and begins to work long
columns of figures, until at length he discovers how
to make a time table which shall set forth the wanderings
of Encke. He is able to verify the accuracy of
his table in a very unmistakable way by venturing
upon prophecies. The mathematician predicts to the
astronomer the very day and the very hour at which
the comet will reappear. He even indicates the very
part of the heavens to which the telescope must be
directed, in order to greet the wanderer on his return.
When the time comes the astronomer finds that his
friend has been a true prophet; there is the comet on
the expected day, and in the expected constellation.</p>

<p>This happens again and again, so that the mathematician,
with his pencil and his figures, marks stage by
stage the progress of Encke through the years of his
invisible voyage. At each moment he knows where the
comet is situated, though utterly unable to see it.</p>

<p>The joint labors of the two friends having thus discovered
law and order in the movements of the comet,
you may judge of their dismay when on one occasion
Encke disappointed them. He appeared, it is true, but
then he was a little late, and he was also not in the
spot where he was expected. There was nearly being
a serious difference between the two friends. The
astronomer accused the mathematician of having made
mistakes in his figures, the mathematician retorted that
the astronomer must have made some blunder in his
observations. A quarrel was imminent, when finally
it was suggested to interrogate Encke himself, and see
whether he could offer any explanation. The mathematician<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
employed peculiar methods that I could not
explain, so I shall transform his processes into a dialogue
between himself and the offending comet.</p>

<p>“You are late,” said he to the comet. “You have
not turned up at the time I expected you, nor are you
exactly in the right place; nor, indeed, for that matter,
are you now moving exactly as you ought to do. In
fact, you are entirely out of order, and what explanation
have you to give of this irregularity?”</p>

<p>You see the questioner felt quite confident that there
must have been some cause at work that he did not
know of. Mathematicians have one great privilege;
they are the only people in the world who never make
any mistakes. If they knew accurately all the various
influences that were at work on the comet, they could,
by working out the figures, have found exactly where
the comet would be placed. If the comet was not there,
it is inevitable that there must have been something
or other acting upon the comet, of which the mathematician
was in ignorance.</p>

<p>The comet, like every other transgressor, immediately
began to make excuses, and to shuffle off the
blame on somebody else. “I was,” said Encke, “going
quietly on my rounds as usual. I was following out
stage by stage the track that you know so well, and
I would certainly have completed my journey and have
arrived here in good time and in the spot where you
expected me had I been let alone, but unfortunately I
was not let alone. In the course of my long travels—but
at a time when you could not have seen me—I
had the misfortune to come very close to a planet, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
which I dare say you have heard—it is called Mercury.
I did not want to interfere with Mercury; I
was only anxious to hurry past and keep on my journey,
but he was meddlesome, and began to pull me
about, and I had a great deal of trouble to get free
from him, but at last I did shake him off. I kept my
pace as well as I could afterwards, but I could not
make up the lost time, and consequently I am here a
little late. I know I am not just where I ought to be,
nor am I now moving quite as you expect me to do;
the fact is, I have not yet quite recovered from the bad
treatment I have experienced.”</p>

<p>The astronomer and the mathematician proceeded
to test this story. They found out what Mercury was
doing; they knew where he was at the time, and they
ascertained that what the comet had said was true, and
that it had come very close indeed to the planet. The
astronomer was quite satisfied, and was proposing to
turn to some other matter, when the mathematician
<span class="locked">said:—</span></p>

<p>“Tarry a moment, my friend. It is the part of a
wise man to extract special benefit from mishaps and
disasters. Let us see whether the tribulations of poor
Encke cannot be made to afford some very valuable
information. We expected to find Encke here. Well,
he is not here—he is there, a little way off. Let us
measure the distance between the place where Encke
is, and the place where he ought to have been.”</p>

<p>This the astronomer did. “Well,” he said, “what
will this tell you? It merely expresses the amount
of delinquency on the part of Encke.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
“No doubt,” said the mathematician, “that is so;
but we must remember that the delinquency, as you
call it, was caused by Mercury. The bigger and the
heavier Mercury was, the greater would be his power
of doing mischief, the more would he have troubled
poor Encke, and the larger would be the derangement
of the comet in consequence of the unfortunate incident.
We have measured how much Encke has actually
been led astray. Had Mercury been heavier than
he is, that distance would have been larger; and if
Mercury had been lighter than he is, you would not,
of course, have found so large an error in the comet.”</p>

<p>We may illustrate what is meant in this way. A
steamer sails from Liverpool to New York, and in
favorable circumstances the voyage across the Atlantic
should be accomplished within a week. But supposing
that in the middle of the ocean a storm is encountered,
by which the ship is driven from her course. She will,
of course, be delayed, and her voyage will be lengthened.
A trifling storm, perhaps, she will not mind, but
a heavy storm might delay her six hours; a still greater
storm might keep her back half a day; while cases are
not infrequent in which the delay has amounted to one
day, or two days, or even more.</p>

<p>The delay which the ship has experienced may be
taken as a measure of the vehemence of the storm. I
am not supposing that her machinery has broken down;
of course, that sometimes happens at sea, as do calamities
of a far more tragic nature. I am merely supposing the
ship to be exposed to very heavy weather, from which
she emerges just as sound as she was when the storm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
began. In such cases as this we may reasonably measure
the intensity of the storm by the number of hours’
delay to which the passengers were subjected. “The
weather we had was much worse than the weather you
had,” one traveller may say to another. “Our ship was
two days late, while you escaped with a loss of one
day.”</p>

<p>When the comet at last returned to the earth after
a cruise of three years through space, the number of
hours by which it was late expressed the vehemence
of the storm it experienced. The only storm that the
comet would have met with, at least in so far as our
present object is concerned, was the trouble that it had
with Mercury. The mass of Mercury was, therefore,
involved in the delay of the comet. In fact, the delay
was a measure of the mass of the planet. I do not
attempt to describe to you all the long work through
which the mathematician had to plod before he could
ascertain the mass of Mercury. It was a very tedious
and a very hard sum, but at last his calculations arrived
at the answer, and showed that Mercury must be a light
globe compared to the earth. In fact, it would take
twenty-five globes, each equal to Mercury, to weigh as
much as the earth.</p>

<p>I dare say you will think that this was a very long
and roundabout way of weighing. Supposing, however,
we had to weigh a mountain, or rather a body which
was bigger than fifty thousand mountains, and which
was also many millions of miles away, all sorts of expedients
would have to be resorted to. I have told you
one of them. If you feel any doubts as to the accuracy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
with which such weighings can be made, then I must tell
you that there are many other methods, and that these
all agree in giving concordant results.</p>

<div id="ifig_49" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 49.</span>—Relative Weights of Mercury and the Earth.</div></div>

<p>We hardly know anything as to what the globe of
Mercury may be like. We can see little or nothing
of the nature of its surface. We only perceive the
planet to be a ball, brightly lighted by the sun, and we
cannot satisfactorily discern permanent features thereon,
as we are able to do on some of the other planets.</p>

<h3>THE PLANET VENUS.</h3>

<p>You will have no difficulty in recognizing Venus, but
you must choose the right time to look out for her. In
the first place, you need never expect to see Venus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
very late at night. You should look for the planet in
the evening, as soon as it is dark, towards the west, or
in the morning, a little before sunrise, towards the east.
I do not, however, say that you can always see Venus,
either before sunrise or after sunset. In fact, for a
large part of the year, this planet is not to be seen at
all. You should therefore consult the almanac, and
unless you find that Venus is stated to be an evening
star or a morning star, you need not trouble to search
for it. I may, however, tell you that Venus can never
be an evening star and a morning star at the same time.
If you can see it this evening after sundown, there is
no use in getting up early in the morning to look out
for it again. The planet will remain for several weeks
a splendid object after sunset, and then will gradually
disappear from the west, and in a couple of months
later will be the morning star in the east. Venus
requires a year and seven months to run through her
changes, so that if you find her a bright evening star
to-night, you may feel sure that she was a bright evening
star a year and seven months ago, and that she will
be a bright evening star in a year and seven months
to come. Nor must you ever expect to see her right
overhead; she is always to the west or to the east.</p>

<p>The splendor of Venus, when at her best, will prevent
you at such times from mistaking this planet for
an ordinary star. She is then more than twenty times
as bright as any star in the heavens. The most conclusive
proof of the unrivalled brightness of Venus is
found in the fact that she can be recognized in broad
daylight without a telescope. Even on the brightest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
June afternoons the lovely planet is sometimes to be
discerned like a morsel of white cloud on the perfect
azure of the sky.</p>

<p>Venus is so brilliant that perhaps you will hardly credit
me when I tell you that she has no more light of her
own than has a stone or a handful of earth, or a button.
Is it possible that this is the case, you will say, for as
we see the planet so exquisitely beautiful, how can she
be merely a huge stone high up in the heavens? The
fact is that Venus shines by light not her own, but by
light which falls upon her from the sun. She is lighted
up just as the moon, or just as our own earth is lighted.
Her radiance merely arises from the sunbeams which
fall upon her. It seems at first surprising that mere
sunbeams on the planet can give her the brilliancy that
is sometimes so attractive. Let me show you an illustration
which will, I trust, convince you that sunbeams
will be adequate even for the glory of Venus.</p>

<p>Here is a button. I hang it by a piece of fine thread,
and when I dip it into the beam from the electric lamp,
look at the brilliancy with which the mimic planet glitters.
You cannot see the shape of the button; it is too
small for that; you merely see it as a brilliant gem,
radiating light all around. Therefore, we need not be
surprised to learn that the brilliancy of the evening star
is borrowed from the sun, and that if, while we are
looking at the planet in the evening, the sun were to
be suddenly extinguished, the planet would also vanish
from view, though the stars would shine as before.</p>

<p>Thus we explain the appearance of Venus. The
evening star is a beautiful, luminous point, but it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
no shape which can be discerned with the unaided eye.
When, however, the telescope is turned towards Venus
we have the delightful spectacle of a tiny moon, which
goes through its phases just as does our own satellite.
When first seen as an evening star Venus will often be
like the moon at the quarter, and then it will pass to
the crescent shape. Then the crescent becomes gradually
thinner, and next will follow a brief period of
invisibility before the appearance of Venus as the morning
star. It seems at first a little strange that Venus
when brightest should not be full like the moon, which
in similar circumstances is, of course, a complete circle
of light. The planet, however, has a very marked
crescent-shaped form in these circumstances. But at
this time the planet is so near us that the gain of brilliancy
from the diminution of distance more than compensates
for the small part of the illuminated side which
is turned towards us.</p>

<p>You ought all to try to get some one to show you
Venus through a telescope. A very large instrument
is not necessary, and I feel sure you will be delighted
to see the beautiful moon-shaped planet. You will then
have no difficulty in understanding how the brightness
of the planet has come from the sun. The changes in
the crescent merely depend upon the proportion of the
illuminated side which is turned towards us. Were
Venus itself a sunlike body we should, of course, see
no crescent, but only a bright circle of light.</p>

<p>In <a href="#ifig_50">Fig. 50</a> you will notice an imaginary picture of a
young astronomer surveying Venus with a telescope. I
have not, as is obvious, attempted to show the different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
objects in their proper proportions. The sun is supposed
to have set, so that his beams do not reach the astronomer.
Night has begun at his observatory; but the
sunbeams fall on Venus, and light her up on that side
turned towards the sun. A part of this lighted side is,
of course, seen by the telescope which the astronomer
is using, and thus the planet seems to him like a crescent
of light.</p>

<h3>THE TRANSIT OF VENUS.</h3>

<p>We might naturally think from <a href="#ifig_46">Fig. 46</a> that Venus
must pass at every revolution directly between the
earth and the sun; and therefore it might appear that
what is called the transit of Venus across the sun ought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
to occur every time between the appearance of the planet
as the evening star and the next following appearance
as the morning star. No doubt on each of these occasions
Venus seems to approach the sun closely; but the
orbits of Venus and the Earth do not lie quite in the
same plane, and hence the planet usually passes just
over or just under the sun, so that it is a very rare
event indeed for her to come right in front of the sun.
But this does sometimes happen. It happened, for
instance, in the year 1874, and again in the year 1882;
but, alas! I cannot hold out to you the prospect of
ever seeing another such spectacle. There will be no
further occurrence of the transit of Venus until the
year 2004, though there will be another eight years
later, in 2012.</p>

<p>It seems rather odd that one transit of Venus should
be followed by another after an interval of eight years,
and that then a period of much more than a century
should have to elapse before there will be a repetition
of a similar pair. This is in consequence of a curious
relation between the motion of Venus and the motion
of the Earth, which I must endeavor to explain with
the help of a little illustration.</p>

<p>Let us suppose a clock with ordinary numbers round
the dial, but so arranged that the slowly moving short
hand requires 365.26 days to complete one revolution
round the dial, while the more rapidly moving long
hand revolves in 224.70 days. The short hand will
then go round once in a year, and the long hand once
during the revolution of Venus. Let us suppose that
both hands start together from XII, then in 224.70<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
days the long hand is round to XII again, but the short
hand will have only advanced to about VII, and by the
time it reaches XII the long hand will have completed
a large part of a second circuit. It happens that the
two numbers 224.70 and 365.26 are very nearly in the
ratio of 8 to 13. In fact, if the numbers had only been
224.8 and 365.3 respectively, they would be exactly in
the proportion of 8 to 13. It, therefore, follows that
eight revolutions of the short hand must occupy very
nearly the same time as thirteen revolutions of the long
hand. After eight years the short hand will of course
be found again at XII; and at the same moment the
long hand will also be back at XII, after completing
thirteen revolutions.</p>

<p>We can now understand why the transits, when they
do occur, generally arrive in pairs at an interval of eight
years. Suppose that at a certain time Venus happens to
interpose itself directly between the earth and the sun,
then, when eight years have elapsed, the earth is, of
course, restored for the eighth time since the first transit
to the same place, and Venus has returned to almost
the same spot for the thirteenth time. The two bodies
are practically in the same condition as they were at
first, and, therefore, Venus again intervenes, and the
planet is beheld as a black spot on the sun’s surface.
We must not push this argument too far; the relation
between the two periods of revolution, though nearly,
is not exactly 8 to 13. The consequence is that when
another eight years have elapsed, the planet passes a
little above the sun or a little below the sun, and thus
a third occurrence of the transit is avoided for more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
than a century. The next transit will take place at the
opposite side of the path.</p>

<p>We were fortunate enough to be able to see the
transit of Venus in 1882 from Great Britain. Perhaps
I should say a part of the transit, for the sun had set
long before the planet had finished its journey across
the disk. Venus looked like a small round black spot,
stealing in on the bright surface of the sun and gradually
advancing along the short chord that formed its
track.</p>

<div id="ifig_51" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22em;">
  <img src="images/i_p157.jpg" width="344" height="335" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 51.</span>—Venus in Transit across the Sun.</div></div>

<p>An immense deal of trouble was taken in 1882, as
well as in 1874, to observe this rare occurrence. Expeditions
were sent to various places over the earth
where the circumstances were favorable. Indeed, I do
not suppose that there was ever any other celestial event<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
about which so much interest was created. The reason
why the event attracted so much attention was not
solely on account of its beauty or its singularity; it was
because the transit of Venus affords us a valuable means
of learning the distance of the sun. When observations
of the transit of Venus made at opposite sides of the
earth are brought together, we are enabled to calculate
from them the distance of Venus, and knowing that,
we can find the distance of the sun and the distances
and the sizes of the planets. This is very valuable
information; but you would have to read some rather
hard books on astronomy if you wanted to understand
clearly how it is that the transit of Venus tells us all
these wonderful things. I may, however, say that the
principle of the method is really the same as that mentioned
on pp. 19–25. When you remember that not
we ourselves, nor our children, and hardly our grandchildren,
will ever be able to see another transit of
Venus, you will, perhaps, not be surprised that we tried
to make the most of such transits as have occurred in
our time.</p>

<h3>VENUS AS A WORLD.</h3>

<p>Though Venus exhibits such pretty crescents in the
telescope, yet I must say that in other respects a view of
the planet is rather disappointing. Venus is adorned
by such a very bright dress of sunbeams that we can
see but little more than those sunbeams, and we can
hardly make out anything of the actual nature of the
planet itself. We can sometimes discern faint marks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
upon the globe, but it is impossible even to make a
conjecture of what the Venus country is like. This is
greatly to be regretted, for Venus approaches comparatively
close to the earth, and is a world so like our own
in size and other circumstances that we feel a legitimate
curiosity to learn something more about her.</p>

<p>But the marks on the planet, though very faint, are
still sufficiently definite to have enabled some sharp-sighted
astronomers to answer a question of much
interest. They have made it plain that in one most
important respect Venus is very unlike our Earth. Our
globe, of course, rotates on its axis once each day, but
Venus requires no less than 225 days to complete each
rotation. In fact, this planet rotates in such a fashion
that she always keeps the same face to the sun. The
inhabitants of Venus will therefore find that it is perennial
day on one side of this globe and everlasting
night on the other.</p>

<p>Venus is one of the few globes which might conceivably
be the abode of beings not very widely different
from ourselves. In one condition especially—namely,
that of weight—she resembles the earth so closely that
those bodies which we actually possess would probably
be adapted, so far as strength is concerned, for a residence
on the sister planet. Our present muscles would
not be unnecessarily strong, as they would be on the
moon, nor should we find them too weak, as they would
certainly prove to be were we placed on one of the very
heavy bodies of our system. Nor need the temperature
of Venus be regarded as presenting any insuperable
difficulties. She is, of course, nearer to the sun than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
we are, but then climate depends on other conditions
besides nearness to the sun, so that the question as to
whether Venus would be too hot for our abode could
not be readily decided. The composition of the atmosphere
surrounding the planet would be the most material
point in deciding whether terrestrial beings could live
there. I think it to be in the highest degree unlikely
that the atmosphere of Venus should chance to suit us in
the requisite particulars, and therefore I think there is
not much likelihood that Venus is inhabited by any
men, women, or children resembling those on this
earth.</p>

<h3>THE PLANET MARS AND HIS MOVEMENTS.</h3>

<p>The path of the earth lies between the orbits of the
planets Venus and Mars. It is natural for us to endeavor
to learn what we can about our neighbors. We
ought to know something, at all events, as to the people
who live next door to us on each side. I have, however,
already said that we cannot observe very much
upon Venus. The case is very different with respect to
Mars. He is a planet which we are fortunately enabled
to study minutely, and he is full of interest when we
examine him through a good telescope.</p>

<p>The right season for observing Mars must, of course,
be awaited, as he is not always visible. Such seasons
recur about every two years, and then for months
together Mars will be a brilliant object in the skies
every night. Nor has Mars necessarily to be sought in
the early morn or immediately after sunset, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
manner we have already described for Venus and
Mercury. At the time Mars is at his best he comes
into the highest position at midnight, and he can
generally be seen for hours before, and be followed for
hours subsequently. You may, however, find some difficulty
in recognizing him. You probably would not at
first be able to distinguish Mars from a fixed star. No
doubt this planet is a ruddy object, but some stars are
also ruddy, and this is at the best a very insecure characteristic
for identification. I cannot give you any
more general directions, except that you should get
your papa to point out Mars to you the next time it is
visible. It is just conceivable that papa himself might
not know how to find Mars. If so, the sooner he gets
a set of star maps and begins to teach himself and to
teach you, the better it will be for you both.</p>

<p>Mars, though apparently so like a star, differs in
some essential points from any star in the sky. The
stars proper are all fixed in the constellations, and
they never change their relative positions. The groups
which form the Great Bear or the Belt of Orion do not
alter, they are just the same now as they were centuries
ago. But the case is very different with a planet such
as Mars. The very word planet means a <em>wanderer</em>, and
it is justly applied, because Mars, instead of staying
permanently in any one constellation, goes constantly
roaming from one group to the other. He is a very
restless body; sometimes he pays his respects to the
heavenly Twins, and is found near Castor and Pollux
in Gemini, then he goes off and has a brief sojourn with
the Bull, but it looks as if that fierce animal got tired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
of his company and hunted him off to the Lion. His
quarters then become still more critical. Sometimes it
looks as if he desired to seek for peace beneath the
waters, and so he visits Aquarius, while at other times
he is found in dangerous proximity to the claws of the
Crab.</p>

<p>Mars cannot even make up his mind to run steadily
round the heavens in one direction; sometimes he will
bolt off rapidly, then pause for a while, and turn back
again; then the original impulse will return, and he
will resume his journey in the direction he at first
intended. It is no wonder that I am not able to give
you very explicit directions as to how you may secure
a sight of a truant whose wanderings are apparently so
uncertain. Yet there is a definite order underlying all
his movements. Astronomers, who make it their business
to study the movements of Mars, can follow him
on his way; they know exactly where he is now, and
where he will be every night for years and years to
come. The people who make the almanacs come to the
astronomers and get hints from them as to what Mars
intends to do, so that the almanacs announce the positions
in which the planet will be found with as much
regularity as if he was in the habit of behaving with
the orderly propriety of the sun or the moon.</p>

<p>We must not lay all the blame on Mars for the
eccentricities of his movements. Our earth is to a very
large extent responsible. What we think to be Mars’
vagaries are often to be explained by the fact that we
ourselves on the earth are rapidly shifting about and
altering our point of view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

<div id="ifig_52" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img src="images/i_p163.jpg" width="419" height="243" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 52.</span>—How the Tree seems to move about.</div></div>

<p>I was driving down a pretty country road with a
little girl three years old beside me, when I was
addressed with the little remark, “Look at the tree
going about in the field.” Now, you or I, with our
longer experience of the world around us, know that it
is not the custom of trees to take themselves up and
walk about the fields. But this was what this little
girl saw, or rather what she thought she saw; and very
often what we do see is something very different from
what we think we see. We think we see Mars performing
all these extraordinary movements, as the little
girl thought she saw the tree moving about. But just
as that little girl, when she grew to be a big girl, found
that what she thought was a tree walking across the
field must really have some quite different explanation,
so we, too, find that what Mars seems to do is one thing,
and what Mars actually does is quite another thing.</p>

<p>Let us see what the little girl noticed. She was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
looking at the tree, and first she saw it on one side of
the house, and then she saw it on the opposite side (<a href="#ifig_52">Fig. 52</a>).
If it had been a cow instead of a tree, of course
the natural supposition would have been that the cow
had walked. Our little friend may, perhaps, have
thought it unusual for a tree to walk, but still she saw
the undoubted fact that the tree had shifted to the
other side of the house, and therefore, perhaps, remembering
what the cow could do, she said the tree had
moved.</p>

<div id="ifig_53" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img src="images/i_p164.jpg" width="372" height="100" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 53.</span>—A Specimen of the Track of Mars.</div></div>

<p>The little girl did not stop to reflect that she herself
had entirely changed her position, and hence arose the
surprising phenomenon of a tree that could move about.
You will understand this, at once, from the two positions
of the car here shown. In the first position, as the girl
looks at the tree, the dotted line shows the direction
of her glance, and the other dotted line shows how the
apparent places of the tree and the house have altered.
It is her change of place that has accomplished the
transformation. Observe also that the tree appeared to
her to move in the direction opposite to that in which
she is going.</p>

<p>Mars generally appears to move round among the
stars from west to east. In fact, if we were viewing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
him from the sun he would always seem to move in
this manner. But at certain seasons our earth is moving
very fast past Mars, and this will make him appear
to move in the opposite direction. This apparent
motion is sometimes so much in excess of his real
motion, that it may give us an entirely incorrect idea
of what the planet is actually doing.</p>

<p>Thus, notwithstanding that Mars is moving one way,
he may appear to us who dwell on the earth to be going
in the opposite way. This illusion only happens for a
short time, just when we are passing Mars, as we do
every two years. The effect on the planet is to make
the path he pursues at this time something like that
shown in <a href="#ifig_53">Fig. 53</a>. The planet is nearest to us at the
time he is moving in this loop. He is then to be seen
at his best in the telescope, so that it is especially interesting
to watch Mars through this critical part of his
career.</p>

<p>I want to show you how to make a little calculation
which will explain the law by which the seasons when
we can see Mars best will follow each other. The period
he requires for a voyage round the sun is not quite two
years, for that would be 730 days, and Mars only takes
687 days for his journey. It is, however, true that 1-15/17
years is very nearly the period of Mars. Hence, every
32 years Mars will complete 17 rounds. From this we
shall be able to see how long it will take after the earth
once passes Mars before they pass again. I shall suppose
there is a circular course, around which two boys
start together to run a race. One of these boys is such
a good runner that he will get quite round in 17 minutes;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
but the other boy can hardly run more than half
as quickly, for he will require 32 minutes to complete
one circle. Here then is the question. Suppose the
two boys to start together: how long will it be before
the faster runner gains one complete circuit on the
other? By the time the good runner (A) has completed
one circuit, the bad runner (B) has only got a
little more than halfway. When A has completed his
second circuit, he has, of course, run for twice 17 minutes—that
is, for 34 minutes. This is two minutes
longer than the time B requires to get round once;
therefore B is only ahead by a distance which A could
cover in about one minute; but B will have advanced
during this minute a distance for which A will require
another half-minute, during which B covers a distance
for which A will need a further quarter, and so on.
But all these intervals—one minute, half a minute, a
quarter of a minute, one-eighth, one-sixteenth, and so
on—added together amount to two minutes, and hence
it follows that B will not be overtaken until about two
minutes after A has completed his second round—that
is, in 36 minutes altogether.</p>

<p>We can pass from this illustration to the case of the
planet Mars and the earth. The orbit of the earth is
traversed in a year, and therefore, after the earth has
once passed Mars, which is then, as astronomers would
say, in <em>opposition</em>, about two years and the eighth of a
year—that is, two years and six or seven weeks—will
elapse before Mars is again favorably placed. You will
thus see that we need not expect to observe Mars under
the best conditions every year. Besides, the distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
of the planet from the earth at opposition varies so
greatly that some oppositions are more favorable than
others.</p>

<p>The time has come when I must tell you something
about the shapes of the paths in which the earth and
the other planets perform their great journeys round
the sun. Perhaps you will think that I am going to
contradict some of the things that I have told you
before. I have often represented the orbits of the planets
as circles, and now I am going to tell you that this
is not correct. The fact is that the paths are nearly
circles; but, still, there is some departure from the
exact circular shape. Mars, in particular, moves in a
path which is more different from a circle than the path
of the earth, and consequently it is appropriate to introduce
this subject when we are engaged about Mars.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 54.</span>—How to draw an Ellipse.</div></div>

<p>We must first take another lesson in drawing, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
the appliances I want you to use for the purpose are
very simple. You must have a smooth board and some
tacks or drawing-pins, besides paper, pencil, and twine.</p>

<div id="ifig_55" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 26em;">
  <img src="images/i_p168.jpg" width="413" height="506" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 55.</span>—Specimens of Ellipses.</div></div>

<p>We first lay a sheet of paper on the board, and then
put in two tacks through the paper and into the board.
It does not much matter where we put them in. Next
we take a piece of twine and tie the two ends together
so as to form a loop, which we pass round the two tacks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
(<a href="#ifig_54">Fig. 54</a>). In the loop I place the pencil, and then you
see I move it round, taking care to keep the twine
stretched. Thus I produce a pretty curve, which we
call the ellipse. I must ask all of you to practise this
experiment. Try with different lengths of string, and
try using different distances between the tacks. Here
are some sketches of two shapes of ellipse and a parabola
(<a href="#ifig_55">Fig. 55</a>). Elliptic curves can be made almost circles
by putting the two tacks close together, or they
can be made very long in comparison with their width.
They are all pretty and graceful figures, and are often
useful for ornamental work. The ellipse is a pretty
shape for beds of flowers in a grass-plot.</p>

<p>The importance of the ellipse to astronomers is
greater than that of any other geometrical figure. In
fact, all the planets, as they perform their long and
unceasing journeys round the sun, move in ellipses;
and though it is true that these ellipses are very nearly
circles, yet the difference is quite appreciable.</p>

<p>It is also important to observe that the sun is not
in the centre of the ellipse which the planet describes.
The sun is nearer to one end than to the other. And
the actual position of the sun must be particularly
noted. Suppose that some mighty giant were preparing
to draw an exact path for the earth, or for Mars, of
course he would want to have millions of miles of string
for producing a big enough curve, and one of the nails
that he used would have to be driven right into the
sun. The following is the astronomer’s more accurate
method of stating the facts. He calls each of the
points represented by the tacks around which the string<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
is looped a <em>focus</em> of the ellipse; the two points together
are said to be the <em>foci</em>; and as the planet is describing
its orbit, the position of the sun will lie exactly at one
of the foci.</p>

<p>The ellipse is a curve that nature is very fond of
reproducing. From an electric light, a brilliant beam
will diverge. If you hold a globe in the beam, and let
the shadow fall on a sheet of paper, it forms an ellipse.
If you hold the sheet squarely, the shadow is a circle;
but as you incline it, you obtain a beautiful oval, and by
gradually altering the position, you can get a greatly
elongated curve. Indeed, you can thus produce an
ellipse of almost any form. The electric light is not
indispensable for this purpose; any ordinary bright
lamp with a small flame will answer, and by taking
different sized balls and putting them in various positions,
you can make many ellipses, great and small.</p>

<h3>THE DISCOVERIES MADE BY TYCHO AND KEPLER.</h3>

<p>It was by the observations of a celebrated old
astronomer, named Tycho Brahe, that the true shape
of a planet’s path came to be afterwards determined.
Tycho lived in days before telescopes were invented.
He had few of the excellent contrivances for measuring
which we have in our observatories. We shall take a
look at this fine old astronomer, as he sits amid his
curious astronomical machines.</p>

him, busily engaged in observing the heavens. You
see the walls of his observatory are decorated with pictures;
and one of the great Danish hounds which the
King of Denmark had presented to him lies asleep at
his feet. I do not think we should now encourage big
dogs in the observatory at night. Nor do modern astronomers
put on their velvet robes of state, as Tycho
was said to have done when he entered into the presence
of the stars, as, by so doing, he showed his respect
for the heavens. Astronomers, nowadays, rather prefer
to wear some comfortable coat which shall keep out
the cold, no matter what may be its appearance from
the picturesque point of view. In this wonderful contrivance,
you see Tycho Brahe did not use any actual
telescope. He observed through a small opening in the
wall, and lest there should be any mistake as to what
is going on, you see he is pointing towards it, and giving
his three assistants their instructions. The most important
work is being done by the man on the right.
He is engaged in making the actual observation. But
he has no aid from magnifying lenses. All he can do
is to slide a pointer up or down till it is just in line
with the planet or star as he sees it through the hole
opposite.</p>

<p>On the circle a number of marks have been engraved,
and there are numbers placed opposite to the marks; it
is by these that the position of the object is to be ascertained.
If the object is high, then the pointer will be
low; and if the object is low, then the pointer will
be high. The observer calls out the position when he
has found it, and there, you see, is a man ready with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
writing materials to take down the observation. Notice
also the other astronomer who is looking at the clock.
He gives the time, which must also be recorded accurately.
In fact, the entire process of finding the place
of a heavenly body consists in two observations—one
from the circle and the other from the clock; so that
though Tycho had no telescope to aid his vision, yet
the principle on which his work was done was the same
as that which we use in our observatories at this
moment.</p>

<p>You may think that such a concern would hardly be
capable of producing much reliable work. However,
Tycho compensated in a great degree for the imperfection
of his instrument by the skill with which he used
it. He had a noble determination to do his very best.
Perseverance will accomplish wonders even with very
imperfect means. A great astronomer has said that
a skilful observer ought to be able to make valuable
measurements with a common cart-wheel!</p>

<p>It was with instruments on the principle of that
which I have here shown that Tycho made his celebrated
observations of Mars. Week after week, month
after month, year after year, did the patient old
astronomer track the planet through his capricious
wanderings.</p>

<p>Before we try to explain anything, it is of course
necessary to ascertain, with all available accuracy,
what the thing actually is. Therefore, when we seek
to explain the irregular movements of a planet, the
first thing to be done is to make a careful examination
of the nature of those irregularities. And this was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
what Tycho strove to do with the best means at his
disposal.</p>

<p>The full benefit of Tycho’s work was realized by
Kepler when he commenced to search out the kind of
figure in which Mars was moving. First he tried various
circles, and then he sought, by placing the centre
in different positions, to see whether it would not be
possible to account thus for the irregularities of the
wayward planet. It would not do; the movement was
not circular. This was thought very strange in those
days, for the circle was regarded as the only perfect
curve, and it was considered quite impossible for a
planet to have any motion except it were the most perfect.
There was, however, no help for it; so Kepler
sagaciously tried the ellipse, which he considered to
be the most perfect curve next to the circle. He continued
his long calculations, until at last he succeeded
in finding one particular ellipse, placed in one particular
position, which would just explain the strange wanderings
of our erratic neighbor. It was not alone that
the motion of the planet traced out an ellipse; it was
further discovered that the sun lies at one of the foci
of the curve. If the sun were anywhere else, the
motion of the planet would have been different from
that which Tycho had found it to be.</p>

<p>You must know that this discovery is one of the very
greatest that have ever been made in the whole extent
of human knowledge. After it had been proved that
the orbit of Mars was elliptic, it became plain that the
same path must be traced by every planet. There are
very big planets, and there are small ones; there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
planets which move in very large orbits, and there are
planets whose paths are comparatively small. In all
cases the high road which the planet follows is invariably
an ellipse, and the sun is invariably to be found
situated at the focus. It is surely interesting to find
that these beautiful ellipses which we can draw so simply
with a piece of twine and a pencil should be also
the very same figures which our great earth and all the
other bodies which revolve around the sun are ever
compelled to follow.</p>

<p>Kepler also made another great discovery in connection
with the same subject. If the planet moved in
a circle with the sun in the centre, then there would be
very good reason to expect that it would always move
at the same speed, for there would be no reason why it
should go faster at one place than at another. In fact,
the planet would then be revolving always at the same
distance from the sun, and every part of its path would
be exactly like every other part. But when we consider
that the motion is performed in an ellipse, so that the
planet is curving round more rapidly at the extremities
of its path than in the other parts where the curvature
is less perceptible, we have no reason to expect that
the speed shall remain the same all round.</p>

<p>We know that the engine-driver of a railway train
always has to slacken speed when he is going round a
sharp curve. If he did not do so, his train would be
very likely to run off the line, and a dreadful accident
would follow. The engine-driver is well aware that
the conditions of pace are dependent on the curvature
of his line. The planet finds that it, too, must pay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
attention to the curves; but the extraordinary point is
that the planet acts exactly in the opposite way to the
engine-driver. The planet puts on its highest pace at
one of the most critical curves in the whole journey.
There are two specially sharp curves in the planet’s
path. These are, of course, the two extremities of the
ellipse which it follows. The cautious engine-driver
would, of course, creep round these with equal care,
and no doubt the planet goes slowly enough about that
end of the ellipse which is farthest from the sun. There
its pace is slower than anywhere else; but from that
moment onwards the planet steadily applies itself to
getting up more and more speed. As it traverses the
comparatively straight portion of the celestial road, the
pace is ever accelerating until the sharp curve near
the sun is being approached; then the velocity gets
more and more alarming, until at last, in utter defiance
of all rules of engine-driving, the planet rushes round
one of the worst parts of the orbit at the highest possible
speed. And yet no accident happens, though the planet
has no nicely laid lines to keep it on the track.</p>

<p>If lines are necessary to save a railway train from
destruction, how can we possibly escape when we have
no similar assistance to keep us from flying away from
the sun and off into infinite space? Kepler has taught
us to measure the changes in the speed of the body
with precision. He has shown that the planet must,
at every point of its long journey, possess exactly the
right speed; otherwise everything would go wrong. I
dare say you have seen, at different points along a line
of railway, boards put up here and there, with notices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
like, “Ten miles an hour.” These words are, of course,
an intimation to the engine-driver that he is not to vary
from the speed thus stated. Kepler has given us a law
which is equivalent to a large number of caution boards,
fixed all round the planet’s path, indicating the safe
speed for the journey at every stage. It is fortunate
for us that the planet is careful to observe these regulations.
If the earth were to leave her track, the
consequences would be far worse than those of the
most frightful railway accident that ever happened.
Whichever side we took would be almost equally disastrous.
If we went inwards we should plunge into
the sun, and if we went outwards we should be frozen
by cold.</p>

<p>We owe our safety to the care with which the speed
of the earth is prescribed. When near the sun, the earth
is pulled inwards with exceptionally strong attraction.
We are often told that when a strong temptation seizes
us, the wisest thing that we can do is to run away as
hard as possible. This is just what the laws of dynamics
cause the earth to do at this critical time. She puts
on her very best pace, and only slackens when she has
got well away from the danger.</p>

<p>The peril that we are exposed to when the earth is
at the other end of the orbit is of an opposite character.
We are then a long way from the sun, and the pull
which it can exercise upon the earth is correspondingly
lessened. Care is then required lest we should escape
altogether from the sun’s warmth and his guidance.
We must therefore give time to the sun to exercise his
power, so as to enable the earth to be recalled; accordingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
we move as slowly as possible until the sun conquers
the earth’s disposition to fly off, and we begin to
return.</p>

<p>You may remember that when we were speaking
about the moon, I showed you how a body might
revolve around the earth in a circle under the influence
of an attraction towards the earth’s centre. So long as
the path is really a circle, then the power with which
the earth is drawing the body remains the same. In a
precisely similar way, a body could revolve around the
sun in a circle, in which case also the attraction of the
sun will remain the same all round. But now we have
a very much more difficult case to consider. If the
body does not always remain at the same distance, the
power of the sun will not be the same at the different
places. Whenever the object is near the sun, the
attraction will be greater than when it is farther off.
For example, when the distance between the two bodies
is doubled, then the pull is reduced to the fourth part
of what it was before.</p>

<h3>THE DISCOVERIES MADE BY NEWTON.</h3>

<p>I have now some great discoveries to talk to you
about, which were made by Sir Isaac Newton. He was
not an astronomer who looked much through a telescope,
though he made many remarkable experiments.
He used to sit in his study and think, and then he used
to draw figures with his pencil, and make long calculations.
At last he was able to give answers to the
questions: What is the reason why the planet moves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
in an ellipse? Why should it move in this curve
rather than in any other? Why should this ellipse
be so placed that the sun lies at one of the foci?</p>

<p>If the planet had run uniformly round its course,
Newton would have found his task an impossible one.
But I have already explained that the motion is not
uniform. I described how the planet hurried along
with extra speed at certain parts of its path; how it
lingered at other parts; how, in fact, it never preserved
the same rate for even a single minute during the whole
journey. Kepler had shown how to make a time-table
for the whole journey. In fact, just as a captain on
a long voyage keeps a record of each day’s run, and
shows how to-day he makes 170 miles, and to-morrow
perhaps 200, and the next day 210, while the day after
he may fall back to 120, so Kepler gave rules by which
the log of a planet in its voyage round the sun might
be so faithfully kept that every day’s run would be
accurately recorded.</p>

<p>When Newton commenced his work, one of the first
questions he had to consider was the following: Suppose
that a great globe like a planet, or a small globe
like a marble, or an irregular body like an ordinary
stone, were to be thrown into space, and were then to
be left to follow its course without any force whatever
acting upon it, where would it go to?</p>

<p>You may say, at once, that a body under such circumstances
will presently fall down to the ground;
and so, of course, it will, if it be near the earth. I am
not, however, talking of anything near the earth; I
want you to imagine a body far off in the depths of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
space, among the stars. Such a body need not necessarily
fall down here, for you see the moon does not fall,
and the sun does not.</p>

<p>If you were at a great distance from our globe and
from all other large globes—so far, indeed, that their
attractions were imperceptible—you could try the
experiment that I wish now to describe. Throw a stone
as hard as ever you can, and what will happen? Of
course, when you do it down here, it moves in a pretty
curve through the air, and tumbles to the ground; but
away in open space, what will the stone do? There
will be no such motion as up or down, as we ordinarily
understand it; for though the earth, no doubt, will lie
in one particular direction at a great distance, yet there
will be other bodies just as large in other directions;
and there is no reason why the stone should move
towards one of these rather than to another; in fact, if
they are all far enough, as the stars are from us, their
attractions will be quite inappreciable. There is, therefore,
not the slightest reason why the stone should
swerve to one side more than to another. There is no
more reason why it should turn to the right than why
it should turn to the left. Nor could you throw the
stone so as to make it follow a curved path. You can,
of course, make it describe a curve while it remains in
your hand, but the moment the stone has left your
hand, it proceeds on its journey by a law over which
you have no control. As the direction cannot be changed
towards one side more than towards the other, the stone
must simply follow a straight line from the very moment
when it is released from your hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
The speed with which the stone is started will also
not change. You might at first think that it would
gradually abate, and ultimately cease. No doubt a
stone thrown along the road will behave in this way,
but that is because the stone rubs against the ground.
If you throw a stone across a sheet of ice, then it will
run a very long distance before it stops, and all the
time it will be moving in a straight line. In this case
there is but little loss by rubbing against the ice, because
it is so smooth. Thus we see that if the path be exceedingly
smooth, the body will run a long way before it
stops. Think of the distance a railway train will run
if, while travelling at full speed along a level line, the
steam is turned off.</p>

<p>These illustrations all show that if you let a body
alone, after having once started it, and do not try to
pull it this way or that way, and do not make it rub
against things, that body will move on continually in a
straight line, and will keep up a uniform speed. We
can apply this reasoning to a stone out in space. It
would certainly move in a straight line, and would go
on and on forever, without losing any of its pace.</p>

<p>I need hardly tell you that no one has ever been able
to try this experiment. In the first place, we reside
upon the surface of the earth, and we have no means of
ascending into those elevated regions where the stone
is supposed to be projected. There is also another difficulty
which we cannot entirely avoid, and that arises
from the resistance of the air. All movements down
here are impeded because the body has to force its way
through the air; and in doing so it invariably loses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
some of its speed. Out in open space there is, of
course, no air, and no loss of speed can therefore arise
from this cause.</p>

<div id="ifig_57" class="figleft" style="max-width: 12em;">
  <img src="images/i_p182.jpg" width="187" height="265" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 57.</span>—The Humming-top.</div></div>

<p>There are, however, several actual experiments by
which we can assure ourselves of the general truth. Set
a humming-top spinning (<a href="#ifig_57">Fig. 57</a>); it gradually comes
to rest, partly because of the rubbing of its point on the
table, and partly because it
has to force its way through
the air. In fact, the hum of
the top that you hear is only
produced at the expense of its
motion. Supposing I use a
much heavier top; if I set it
spinning it will keep up for
many minutes, because its
weight gives it a better store
of power wherewith to overcome
the resistance of the air.
I remember hearing a story
about Professor Clerk-Maxwell. He had, when at Cambridge,
invented one of these large and heavy tops, which
would spin for a long time. One evening the top was
left spinning on a plate in his room when his friends
took their departure, and no doubt it came to rest in due
time. Early the next morning, Professor Maxwell,
hearing the same friends coming up to his rooms again,
jumped out of bed, set the top spinning, and then got
back to bed, and pretended to be asleep. He thus
astounded his friends, who, of course, imagined that
the top must have been spinning all the night long!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
If we spin a top under the receiver of an air pump
(<a href="#ifig_58">Fig. 58</a>), it will keep up its motion for a very much
longer time after the air has been exhausted than it
would in ordinary circumstances. Such experiments
prove that the motion of a body will not of itself naturally
die out, and that if we could only keep away the
interfering forces altogether, the motion would continue
indefinitely with unabated speed. What I have been
endeavoring to illustrate is called the first law of motion.
It is written <span class="locked">thus:—</span></p>

<p>“<em>Every body continues in its state of rest or of uniform
motion in a straight line, except in so far as it may
be compelled by impressed forces to change that state.</em>”</p>

<div id="ifig_58" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_p183.jpg" width="391" height="318" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 58.</span>—To illustrate the First Law of Motion.</div></div>

<p>I would recommend you to learn this by heart. I
can assure you it is quite as well worth knowing as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
those rules in the Latin Grammar with which many of
you, I have no doubt, are acquainted. The best proof
of the first law of motion is derived, not from any
experiments, but from astronomy. We make many
calculations about the movements of the sun, the moon,
the stars, and then we venture on predictions, and we
find those predictions verified. Thus we had a transit
of Venus across the sun in 1882, and every astronomer
knew that this was going to occur, and many went to
the ends of the earth so that they might see it favorably.
Their anticipations were realized; they always
are. Astronomers make no mistakes in these matters.
They know that there will be another transit of Venus
in the year 2004, but not sooner. The calculations by
which these accurate prophecies are made involve this
first law of motion; and as we find that such prophecies
are always fulfilled, we know that the first law of motion
must be true also.</p>

<p>Newton knew that if a planet were merely left alone
in space, it would continue to move on forever in a
straight line. But Kepler had shown that the planet
did not move in a straight line, but that it described an
ellipse. One conclusion was obvious. There must be
some force acting upon the planet which pulls it away
from the straight line it would otherwise pursue. We
may, for the sake of illustration, imagine this force to
be applied by a rope attached to the planet so that at
every moment it is dragged by some unseen hand. To
find the direction this rope must have, we take the law
of Kepler, which explains the rules according to which
the planet varies its speed. I cannot enter into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
question fully, as it would be too difficult for us to discuss
now. I should have to talk a great deal more about
mathematics than would be convenient just at present;
but I think you can all understand the result to
which Newton was led. He showed that the rope must
always be directed towards the sun. In other words,
suppose that there was no sun, but that in the place
which it occupied there was a strong enough giant constantly
pulling away at the planet, then we should find
that the speed of the planet would alter just in the way
it actually does. Thus we learn that some force must
reside in the sun by which the planet is drawn, and
this force is exerted, although there is no visible bond
between the sun and the planet.</p>

<p>There is another fact to be learned about the sun’s
attraction, and this time we obtain it by knowing the
shape of the curve followed by the planet. The laws
by which the planet’s speed is regulated prove that the
force emanates from the sun. We shall now learn
much more when we take into account that the path
of the planet is an ellipse, of which the sun lies at
the focus. Nothing has been said as yet regarding the
magnitude of the pull which is being exerted by the
sun. Is that pull to be always the same, or is it to be
greater at some times than at other times? Newton
showed that no ellipse other than a circle could be
described, if the pull from the sun were always the
same. Its magnitude must be continually changed,
and the nearer the planet lies to the sun, the more
vehement is the pull it receives. Newton laid down
the exact law by which the force on the planet at any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
one place in its path could be compared with the force
at any other position. Let us suppose that the planet
is in a certain position, and that it then passes into a
second position, which is twice as far from the sun.
The pull upon the planet at the shorter distance is not
only greater than the pull at the longer distance, but
it is actually four times as much. Stating this result
a little more generally, we assert, in the language of
astronomers, that the <em>attraction varies inversely as the
square of the distance</em>. If this law were departed from,
then I do not say that it would be impossible for the
planet to revolve around the sun in some fashion, but
the motion would not be performed in an ellipse described
around the sun in the focus.</p>

<p>You see how very instructive are the laws which
Kepler discovered. From the first of them we were
able to infer that the sun attracts the planets; from
the second, we have learned how the magnitude of the
attracting force varies.</p>

<p>The true importance of these great discoveries will
be manifest when we compare them with what we have
already learned with regard to the movements of the
moon. As the moon revolves around the earth it is
held by the earth’s attraction, and the moon follows a
path which, though nearly a circle, is really an ellipse.
This orbit is described around the earth just as the
earth describes its path around the sun. That law by
which a stone falls to the ground in consequence of the
earth’s attraction is merely an illustration of a great
general principle. Every body in the whole universe
attracts every other body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
Think of two weights lying on the table. They no
doubt attract each other, but the force is an extremely
small one—so small, indeed, that you could not measure
it by any ordinary appliance. One or both of the
attracting masses must be enormously big if their
mutual gravitation is to be readily appreciable. The
attraction of the earth on a stone is a considerable
force, because the earth is so large, even though the
stone may be small. Imagine a pair of colossal solid
iron cannon-balls, each 53 yards in diameter, and weighing
about 417,000 tons. Suppose these two globes were
placed a mile apart, the pull of one of them on the other
by gravitation would be just a pound weight. Notwithstanding
the size of these masses, the hand of a child
could prevent any motion of one ball by the attraction
of the other. If, however, they were quite free to move,
and there was absolutely no friction, the balls would
begin to draw together; at first they would creep so
slowly that the motion would hardly be noticed. The
pace would no doubt continue to improve slowly, but
still not less than three or four days must elapse before
they will have come together.</p>

<p>By the kindness of Professor Dewar, I am enabled to
exhibit a contrivance with which we can illustrate the
motion of a planet around the sun. Here is a long wire
suspended from the roof of this theatre, and attached
to its lower end is an iron ball, made hollow for the
sake of lightness. When I draw the ball aside, it
swings to and fro with the regularity of a great pendulum.
But when I place a powerful magnet in its
neighborhood (<a href="#ifig_59">Fig. 59</a>), you see that as soon as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
ball gets near the magnet it is violently drawn to one
side, and follows a curved path. This magnet may be
taken to represent the sun, while the ball is like our
earth, or any other planet, which would move in a
straight line were it not for the attraction of the sun
which draws the body aside.</p>

<h3>THE GEOGRAPHY OF MARS.</h3>

<p>We will now say something with respect to the
geography of our fellow-planet, a subject which seems
all the more interesting because Mars is so like the
earth in many respects. We require a fairly good telescope
for the purpose of seeing him well, but when
such an instrument is directed to the planet, a beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
picture of another world is unfolded (<a href="#ifig_60">Fig. 60</a>).
There are many things visible on his surface, but we
must always remember that even with our most powerful
telescopes the planet still appears a long way off.</p>

<div id="ifig_60" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">

  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 61.</span>—Mars.</p>

<p>(<cite>By Douglass, Lowell Observatory.</cite>)</p></div></div>

<p>In the most favorable circumstances, Mars is at least
one hundred times as far from us as the moon. But
we know that an object on the moon must be as large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
as St. Paul’s Cathedral if it is to be visible in our telescopes.
An object on Mars must be, therefore, at least
one hundred times as broad and one hundred times
as long as St. Paul’s Cathedral if it is to be discernible
by astronomers on our earth. We can, therefore,
only expect to see the general features of our fellow-planet.
Were we looking at our earth from a similar
distance, and with equally good telescopes, the continents
and oceans, and the larger seas and islands, would
all be large enough to be conspicuous. It is, however,
doubtful whether they could ever be properly revealed
through the serious impediment to vision which our
atmosphere would offer.</p>

<p>It fortunately happens that the surface of Mars is
only obscured by clouds to a very trifling extent, and
we are thus able to see a panorama of our neighboring
globe laid before us. Mars is not nearly so large as our
earth, the diameters of the two bodies being nearly as
two to one. It follows that the number of acres on the
planet is only a quarter of the number of acres on the
earth. Careful telescopic scrutiny shows that the chief
features which we see on Mars are of a permanent character.
In this respect Mars is much more like the moon
than the sun. The latter presents to us merely glowing
vapors, with hardly more permanence than is possessed
by the clouds in our own sky. On the other
hand, the entire absence of clouds from the moon
enables us to see the permanent features on its surface.
Most of the visible features on Mars are also invariable;
though occasionally it would seem that the climate produces
some changes in its appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 62.</span>—The South Pole of Mars, September, 1877 (<cite>Green</cite>).</div></div>

<p>We first notice that there are differently colored
parts on Mars. The darkish or bluish regions are
usually spoken of as seas or oceans; though we should
be going beyond our strict knowledge were we to
assert that water is actually found there. Look at the
horn-shaped object in the centre of the lower picture
in <a href="#ifig_60">Fig. 60</a>. We call it the Kaiser Sea, and it is so
strongly marked that even in a small telescope it can
be often seen. You must not, however, always expect to
notice this feature when you look at the planet through
a telescope, for it turns round and round. We can make
a globe representing Mars. On this are to be depicted
this great sea and the other characteristic objects. But
as we turn the globe around, the opposite side of the
planet is brought into view, and other features are
revealed like those represented in the upper figure.
Mars requires 24 hours 37 minutes 22.7 seconds to
complete a single rotation. It is somewhat remarkable
that this only differs from the earth’s period of rotation
by a little more than half an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
Mars contains what we call continents as well as
oceans, and we also find there lakes and seas and
straits. These objects are indicated in the drawings
that are here represented. But the most striking features
which the planet displays are the marvellous
white regions, which are seen both at its North Pole
and at its South Pole (<a href="#ifig_62">Fig. 62</a>). If we were able to
soar aloft above our earth and take a bird’s-eye view of
our own polar regions, we should see a white cap at the
middle of the arctic circle. This appearance would be
produced by the eternal ice and snow. It would increase
during the long, dark winter, and be somewhat
reduced by melting during the continuously bright
summer. Though we cannot thus see our earth, yet
we can sometimes observe one Pole of Mars and sometimes
the other, and we find each of these Poles crowned
with a dense white cap, which increases during the
severity of its winter, and which declines again with
the warmth of the ensuing summer.</p>

<p>Sketches of Mars have been made by many astronomers;
among them we may mention Mr. Green, who
made a beautiful series of pictures at Madeira in 1877.
These may be supplemented by the drawings of Mr.
Knobel in 1884, when the opposite Pole of the planet
was turned to view. The drawings show the polar snows,
and there seem to be some elevated districts in his arctic
regions which retain a little patch of snow after the main
body of the ice cap has shrunk within its summer limits.
An interesting case of this kind is shown in <a href="#ifig_62">Fig. 62</a>,
which has been copied from one of Mr. Green’s drawings.</p>

<p>It has lately been surmised that the continents on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
Mars are occasionally inundated by floods of water.
There are also indications of clouds hanging over the
Martian lands, but the inhabitants of that planet, in
this respect, escape much better than we do. A certain
amount of atmosphere always surrounds Mars, though
it is much less copious than that we have here. As to
the composition of this atmosphere we know nothing.
For anything we can tell, it might be a gas so poisonous
that a single inspiration would be fatal to us; or if
it contained oxygen in much larger proportion than our
air does, it might be fatal from the mere excitement to
our circulation which an over-supply of stimulant would
produce. I do not think it the least likely that our
existence could be supported on Mars, even if we could
get there. We also require certain conditions of climate,
which would probably be totally different from
those we should find on Mars.</p>

<p>Many remarkable observations of Mars have been
lately made by Mr. Percival Lowell. It seems very
doubtful how far our former division of continents and
oceans on Mars can be maintained. Mr. Lowell has
paid special attention to a wonderful system of lines
on the planet’s surface to which the name of “canals”
has been given, which often show such a degree of regularity
as would almost suggest the idea that they had
been laid down by intelligent guidance.</p>

<h3>THE SATELLITES OF MARS.</h3>

<p>When Mars appeared in his full splendor in 1877,
he was for the first time honored with the notice of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
instruments capable of doing him justice. I do not,
however, mean that in former apparitions he was not
also carefully observed, but a great improvement had
recently taken place in telescopes, and it was thus under
specially favorable auspices that his return was welcomed
in 1877. This year will be always celebrated
in astronomical history for a beautiful discovery made
by Professor Asaph Hall, the illustrious astronomer at
Washington.</p>

<p>Before I can explain what this discovery was, I must
have a little talk about moons, or satellites as they are
often called. You know that we have one moon, which
is constantly revolving round the earth, and accompanies
the earth in its long voyage round the sun. But
the earth is only a planet, and there are many other
planets which are worlds like ours. It is natural to
compare these worlds, and as we have one moon, why
should not the other planets also have moons? If there
are children in one house in a square, why should there
not be children in the other houses? We find that
some of the other planets have satellites, but they do
not seem to be distributed very regularly. In fact, they
are almost as capriciously allotted as the children
would be in eight houses that you might take at
random.</p>

<div id="ifig_63" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 26em;">
  <img src="images/i_p196.jpg" width="401" height="403" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 63.</span>—Mars and his Two Satellites.</div></div>

<p>In Number One there lives an old bachelor, and in
Number Two a single lady. These are Mercury and
Venus, and of course there are no children in either of
these houses. Number Three is inhabited by old mother
Earth, and she has got a fine big son, called the Moon.
Number Four is a nice little house inhabited by Mars.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
There are to be found a pair of little twins, and nimble
creatures they are too. Number Five is a great mansion.
A very big man lives here, called Jupiter, with
four robust sons and daughters that everybody knows.
I fancy they must go to many dancing parties, for every
night they may be seen whirling round and round. For
three hundred years these four moons have been known
to astronomers, but in 1892 there was an addition to
the family in the shape of a tiny moon which had never
been seen up to that time. Number Six is also a fine
big house, though not quite so big as Number Five, but
larger than any of the others. It is inhabited by Saturn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
and contains the biggest family of all. Up till the
other day eight sons and daughters were known to live
here, but they are not nearly so sturdy as Jupiter’s
children; in fact, the young Saturns do not make much
display, and some of them are so delicate that they are
hardly ever seen. In this household, too, a new member
has recently appeared. For fifty years the family was
known to consist of these eight sons and daughters, but
in August, 1898, when they were being photographed
in a group, it was discovered that a ninth moon had
been added. Number Seven is also a fine large house;
but Uranus, who lives there, is such a recluse that
unless you carefully keep your eye on his house, you
will hardly ever catch a glimpse of him. There are
four children in that house, I believe, but we hardly
know them. They move in circles of their own, and
apparently have seen a good deal of trouble. Only one
more house is to be mentioned, and that is Number
Eight, inhabited by Neptune. It contains one child,
but we are hardly on visiting terms with this household,
and we know next to nothing about it.</p>

<p>Before 1877, Mars appeared to be in the same condition
as Venus or Mercury—that is, devoid of the dignity
of attendants. There was, however, good reason
for thinking that there might be some satellites to Mars,
only that we had not seen them. You see that, as Number
Three had one child, and Numbers Five, Six, Seven,
and Eight had each one, or more than one, it seemed
hard that poor Number Four should have none at all.
It was, however, certain that if there were any satellites
to Mars, they must be comparatively small things; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
if Mars had even one considerable moon, it must have
been discovered long ago.</p>

<p>On the memorable occasion in 1877, Professor Hall
discovered that the ruddy planet Mars was attended,
not alone by one moon, but by two. Their behavior
was most extraordinary. It appeared to him at first
almost as if one of these little moons was playing at
hide-and-seek. Sometimes it would peep out at one
side of the planet, and sometimes at the other side.
I have here a picture (<a href="#ifig_63">Fig. 63</a>) which shows how these
moons of Mars revolve. That is the globe of the planet
himself in the middle, and he is turning round steadily
in a period which is nearly the same as our day. But
the remarkable point is that the inner of the moons of
Mars runs round the planet in 7 hours 39 minutes. It
would seem very strange in our sky if we had a little
moon which rose in the west instead of in the east, and
which galloped right across the heavens three times
every day—and this is what Mars has. The outer moon
takes a more leisurely journey, for he requires 30 hours
18 minutes to complete a circuit. If for no other reason
than to see these wonderful moons, it would be very
interesting to visit Mars.</p>

<p>The satellites of this planet are in contrast to our
moon. In the first place, our moon takes 27 days to go
round the earth, and is comparatively a long way off.
The moons of Mars are much nearer to their planet,
and they go round much more quickly. There is also
another difference. The moons of Mars are much
smaller bodies than our moon. If we represent Mars
by a good-sized football, his moons, on the same scale,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
would be hardly so big as the smallest-sized grains of
shot. Does it not speak well for the power of telescopes
in these modern days that objects so small as the satellites
of Mars should be seen at all? You remember, of
course, that neither Mars himself nor his moons have
any light of their own. They shine solely in consequence
of the sunlight which falls upon them. They
are merely lighted like the earth itself, or like the
moon. The difficulty about observing the satellites is
all the greater because they are seen in the telescope
close to such a brilliant body as Mars. The glare from
the bright planet is such that when we want to see
faint objects like the satellites we have to hide Mars, so
as to get a comparatively dark space in which to search.</p>

<p>Now that they know exactly what to look for, a
good many astronomers have observed the satellites of
Mars. A superb telescope is nevertheless required.
And, in fact, you could not find a better test for the
excellence of an instrument than to try if it will show
these delicate objects. But do not imagine that merely
having a good telescope and a clear sky is all that is
requisite for making astronomical discoveries. You
might just as well say that by putting a first-rate
cricket-bat in any man’s hands will ensure his making a
grand score. Every boy knows that the bat does not
make the cricketer, and I can assure him that neither
will the telescope make the astronomer. In both cases,
no doubt, there is some element of luck. But of this
you may be certain: that as it is the man that makes
the score, and not the bat, so it is the astronomer that
makes the discovery, and not his telescope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
Deimos and Phobos were the names of the two personages,
according to Homer, whose duty it was to
attend on the god Mars, and to yoke his steeds. A
conclave of classical scholars and astronomers appropriately
decided that Deimos and Phobos must be the
names of the two satellites to the planet which bears
the name of Mars.</p>

<h3>HOW THE TELESCOPE AIDS IN VIEWING FAINT
OBJECTS.</h3>

<p>We have been hitherto talking about large planets,
which, if not as big as our earth, are at least as big as
our moon. But now we have to say a few words about
a number of little planets, many of them being so very
small that a million rolled together would not form a
globe so big as this earth. These little objects you
cannot see with your unaided eye, and even with a telescope
they only look like very small stars.</p>

<p>I have often been asked why it is that a telescope
enables us to see objects, both faint and small, which
our unaided eyes fail to show. Perhaps this will be
a good opportunity to say a few words on the subject.
I think we can explain the utility of the telescope by
examining our own eyes. The eye undergoes a remarkable
transformation when its owner passes from darkness
into a brilliantly lighted room (<a href="#ifig_64">Fig. 64</a>). Here you see
two views of an eye, and you notice the great difference
between them. They are not intended to be the eyes
of two different people, or the two eyes of the same
person; they are merely two conditions of the same eye.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
They are intended to illustrate two different states of
the eye of a collier. The right shows his eye when he
is above ground in bright daylight; the left is his eye
when he has gone down the coal-pit to his useful work
in the dark regions below. I remember when I went
down a coal-pit I was lowered down a long shaft, and
when the bottom was reached a safety lamp was handed
to me. The gloom was such, that at first I found some
little difficulty in guiding my steps, but the capable
guide beside me said in an encouraging voice, “You
will be all right, sir, in a few moments, for you will get
your <em>pit-eyes</em>.” I did get my “pit-eyes,” as he promised,
and was able to see my way along sufficiently to enjoy the
wonderful sights that are met with in the depths below.</p>

<div id="ifig_64" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img src="images/i_p201.jpg" width="419" height="142" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="floatl in4">This shows the Eye in<br />
the Dark.</p>

<p class="floatr l4">This shows the Eye in<br />
the Daylight.</p>

<p class="floatc"><span class="smcap">Fig. 64.</span></p></div></div>

<p>The change that came over my eyes is that which
these two pictures illustrate: the black, round spot in
the centre is an opening covered with a transparent
window, by which light enters the eye; the black spot
is called the pupil, and nature has provided a beautiful
contrivance by which the pupil can get larger or smaller,
so as to make vision agreeable. When there is a great
deal of light we limit the amount that enters by contracting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
the pupil so as to make the opening smaller.
Thus the picture with the small pupil represents the
state of the collier’s eye when he is above ground in
bright sunlight. When he descends into the pit, where
the light is very scanty, then he wants to grasp as much
of it as ever he can, and consequently his pupil enlarges
so as to make a wider opening, and this is what he calls
getting his “pit-eyes.”</p>

<p>But you need not go down a coal-mine to see the
use of the iris—for so that pretty membrane is called
which surrounds the pupil. Every time you pass from
light into darkness the same thing can be perceived.
When we turn down the lights in a room, so that we are
in comparative darkness, our pupils gradually expand.
As soon as the lights are turned up again, then our
pupils begin to contract. Other animals have the same
contrivance in their eyes. You may notice in the
Zoölogical Gardens how quickly the pupil of the lion
contracts when he raises his eyes to the light. The
power of rapidly changing the pupil might be of service
to a beast of prey. Imagine him crouching in a dense
shade to wait for his dinner; then of course the pupil
will be large from deficiency of light; but when he
springs out suddenly on his victim, in bright light, it
would surely be of advantage to him to be able at once
to see clearly. Accordingly his pupil adjusts itself to
the altered conditions with a rapidity that might not
be necessary for creatures of less predaceous habits.</p>

<p>These changes of the pupil explain how the telescope
aids our eyes when we want to discern any faint objects,
like the little planets. Such bodies are not visible to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
the unaided eyes, because our pupils are not large
enough to grasp sufficient light for the purpose. Even
when they are opened to the utmost, we want something
that shall enable them to open wider still. We must
therefore borrow assistance from some device which
shall have an effect equivalent to an enlargement of
the pupil beyond the limits that nature has actually
assigned to it. What we want is something like a
funnel which shall transform a large beam of rays into a
small one. I may explain what I mean by the following
illustration: Suppose that it is raining heavily, and
that you want to fill a bucket with water. If you
merely put the bucket out in the middle of a field, it
will never be filled; but bring it to where the rain-shoot
from a house-top is running down, and then your bucket
will be running over in a few moments. The reason,
of course, is that the broad top of the house has caught
a vast number of drops and brought them together in
the narrow shoot, and so the bucket is filled. In the
same way the telescope gathers the rays of light that
fall on the object glass, and condenses them into a small
beam which can enter the eye. We thus have what is
nearly equivalent to an eye with a pupil as big as the
object glass. Thus the effect of a grand telescope
amounts to a practical increase of the pupil from the
size of a threepenny-piece up to that of a dinner-plate,
or even much larger still.</p>

<h3>THE ASTEROIDS OR SMALL PLANETS.</h3>

<p>An asteroid is like a tiny star, and in fact the two
bodies are very often mistaken. If we could get close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
to the objects, we should see a wide difference between
them. We should find the asteroid to be a dark planet
like our earth, lighted only by the rays from the sun.
The star, small and faint though it may seem, is itself a
bright sun, at such a vast distance that it is only visible
as a small point. The star is millions of times as far
from us as the planet, and utterly different in every
respect.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that the planets should happen to
resemble the stars so closely. We can find an analogous
fact in quite another part of nature. In visiting a good
entomological collection, you will be shown some of
the wonderful leaf-like insects. These creatures have
wings, exactly formed to imitate leaves of trees, with
the stalks and veins completely represented. When
one of these insects lies at rest, with its wings folded,
among a number of leaves, it would be almost impossible
to penetrate the disguise. This mimicry is no
doubt an ingenious artifice to deceive the birds or other
enemies that want to eat the insect. There is, however,
one test which the cunning bird could apply: the
leaves do not move about of their own accord, but the
leaf-insects do. If therefore the bird will only have
the patience to wait, he will see a pair of the seeming
leaves move, and then the deception will be to him a
deception no longer, and he will gobble up the poor
insect.</p>

<p>In our attempts to discover the planets we experience
just the same difficulties as the insect-eating bird.
Wide as is the true difference between a planet and a
star, there is yet such a seeming resemblance between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
them that we are often puzzled to know which is which.
The planets imitate the stars so successfully, that when
one of them is presented to us among myriads of stars
it is impossible for us to detect the planet by its appearance.
But we can be cunning—we can steadily watch,
and the moment we find one of these star-like points
beginning to creep about we can pounce upon it. We
know by its movements that it is only disguised as a
star, but that it is really one of the planets.</p>

<p>It is not always easy to discover the asteroids even
by this principle, for unfortunately these bodies move
very slowly. If you have a planet in the field of
view, it will creep along so gradually that an hour or
more must have elapsed before it has shifted its position
with respect to the neighboring stars to any appreciable
extent. The search for such little planets is
therefore a tedious one, but there are two methods of
conducting it: the new one, which has only recently
come into use, and the old one. I shall speak of the
old one first.</p>

<p>Although the body’s motion is so slow, yet when
sufficient time is allowed, the planet will not only move
away from the stars close by, but will even journey
round the entire heavens. The surest way of making
the discovery is to study a small part of the heavens
now and to examine the same locality again months or
years afterwards. Memory will not suffice for this purpose.
No one could recollect all the stars he saw with
sufficient distinctness to be confident that the field of
the telescope on the second occasion contained either
more or fewer stars than it did on the first. The only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
way of doing this work is to draw a map of the stars
very carefully. This is a tedious business, for the stars
are so numerous that even in a small part of the heavens
there will be many thousands of stars visible in the
telescope. All of these will have to be entered faithfully
in their true places on the map. When this has
been done the map must be laid aside for a season, and
then it is brought out again and compared with the sky.
No doubt the great majority of the objects will be found
just as they were before. These are the stars, the distant
suns, and our concern is not at present with them.
Sometimes it will happen that an object marked on the
first map has left a vacant place on the second. This,
however, does not help us much, for, whatever the
object was, it has vanished into obscurity, and a new
planet could hardly be discovered in this way. But
sometimes it will happen that there is a small point of
light seen in the second map which has no corresponding
point in the first. Then, indeed, the expectation of
the astronomer is aroused; he may be on the brink of a
discovery. Of course he watches accurately the little
stranger. It might be some star that had been accidentally
overlooked when forming the map, or it might
possibly be a star that has become bright in the interval.
But here is a ready test: is the body moving? He
looks at it very carefully, and notes its position with
respect to the adjacent stars. In an hour or two his
suspicions may be confirmed; if the object be in motion,
then it is really a planet. A few further observations,
made on subsequent days, will show the path of the
body. And the astronomer has only to assure himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
that the object is not one of the planets that have been
already found before he announces his discovery.</p>

<p>The new method of searching for small planets,
which has only come into use in recent years, is a very
beautiful one, and renders the process of making such
discoveries much more easy than the older method
which I have just described.</p>

<p>We can take photographs of the heavenly bodies by
adjusting a sensitive plate in the telescope so that the
images of the objects we desire to see shall fall upon
it. The method will apply to very small stars, if by
excellent clockwork and careful guiding we can keep
the telescope constantly pointing to the same spot until
the stars have had time to imprint their little images.
Thus we obtain a map of the heavens, made in a thoroughly
accurate manner. Indeed, the delicacy of photography
for this purpose is so great, that the plates
show many stars which cannot be seen with even the
greatest of telescopes. Suppose that a little planet
happened to lie among the stars which are being photographed.
All the time that the plate is being exposed
the wanderer is, of course, creeping along, and after an
hour (exposures even longer are often used), it may
have moved through a distance sufficient to ensure its
detection. The plate will, therefore, show the stars
as points, but the planet will betray its presence by
producing a streak.</p>

<p>The asteroids now known number between 400 and
500. Out of this host a few afford some information
to the astronomer, but the majority of them are objects
possessing individually only the slightest interest. No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
small planet is worth looking at as a telescopic picture.
We should consider that asteroid to be a large one
which possessed a surface altogether as great as England
or France. Many of these planets have a superficial
extent not so large as some of our great counties.
A globe which was just big enough to be covered by
Yorkshire—if you could imagine that large county
neatly folded round it—would make a very respectable
minor planet.</p>

<p>We know hardly anything of the nature of these
small worlds, but it is certain that any living beings
they could support must have a totally different nature
from the creatures that we know on this earth. We
can easily prove this by making a calculation. I shall
suppose a small planet one hundred miles wide, its
diameter being, therefore, the one-eightieth part of the
diameter of the earth. If we were landed on such a
globe, we should be far more puzzled by the extraordinary
lightness of everything than we should be in the
similar case of the moon to which I referred (<a href="#Page_128">p. 124</a>).
If we suppose the planet to be constructed of materials
which had the same density as those of which the earth
is made, then every weight would be reduced to the
eightieth part of what it is here.</p>

<p>There would be one curious consequence of residence
on such a globe. We have heard of attempts to
make flying machines, or to provide a man with wings
by which he shall soar aloft like the birds. All such
contrivances have hitherto failed. It may be possible
to make a pair of wings by which a man can fly down,
but it is quite another matter when he tries to fly up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
again. Suppose, however, we were living on a small
planet, it would be perfectly easy to fly, for as our
bodies would only seem to weigh a couple of pounds,
we ought to be able to flap a pair of wings strong
enough to overcome so trivial a force. I should, however,
add that this is on the supposition that the atmosphere
has the same density as our own.</p>

<p>Life on these small planets would indeed be extraordinary.
Let us take, for example, Flora, and
see how a game of lawn tennis on that body would be
managed. The very slightest blow of the racket would
drive the ball a prodigious distance before it could
touch the ground; indeed, unless the courts were about
half a mile long, it would be impossible to serve any
ball that was not a fault. Nor is there any great exertion
necessary for playing lawn tennis on Flora, even
though the courts are several hundred acres in extent.
As a young lady ran to meet the ball and return it,
each of her steps might cover a hundred yards or so
without extra effort; and should she have the misfortune
to get a fall, her descent to the ground would be
as gentle as if she was seeking repose on a bed of the
softest swan’s-down.</p>

<p>These little planets cluster together in a certain part
of our system. Inside are the four inner planets, of
which we have already spoken; outside are the four
outer planets, of which we have soon to speak. Between
these two groups there was a vacant space. It
seemed unreasonable that where there was room for
planets, planets should not be found. Accordingly the
search was made, and these objects were discovered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
Even at the present day, more and more are being
constantly added to the list.</p>

<p>Up till quite recently all the small planets which
had been discovered confined themselves to the space
lying between the paths of the major planets Mars and
Jupiter. This invariable rule was, however, departed
from in the case of one of these bodies which was discovered
in August, 1898. This little body, which was
known for some time by the provisional appellation of
D Q, and which has now been definitely christened
Eros, is an exception to this rule. It travels at an
average distance from the sun actually less than that
of Mars, and at the nearest point can come within
15,000,000 miles of the earth.</p>

<p>We occasionally get information from these little
bodies; for in their revolutions through the solar system,
they sometimes pick up scraps of useful knowledge,
which we can elicit from them by careful examination.
For example, one of the most important problems in the
whole of astronomy is to determine the sun’s distance.
I have already mentioned one of the ways of doing this,
which is given by the transit of Venus. Astronomers
never like to rely on a single method; we are therefore
glad to discover any other means of solving the same
problem. This it is which the little planets will sometimes
do for us. Juno on one occasion approached very
close to the earth, and astronomers in various parts of
the globe observed her at the same time. When they
compared their observations they measured the sun’s
distance. But I am not going to trouble you now with
a matter so difficult. Suffice it to say, that for this, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
for all similar investigations, the observers were constrained
to use the very same principle as that which
we illustrated in <a href="#ifig_5">Fig. 5</a>.</p>

<p>Let me rather close this lecture with the remark that
we have here been considering only the lesser members
of the great family which circulate round the sun, and
that we shall speak in our next lecture of the giant
members of our system.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">Our</span> lecture to-day ought to make us take a very
humble view of the size of our earth. Mercury, Venus,
and Mars may be regarded as the earth’s peers, though
we are slightly larger than Venus, and a good deal
larger than Mercury or Mars; but all these four globes
are insignificant in comparison with the gigantic planets
which lie in the outer parts of our system. These
great bodies do not enjoy the benefits of the sun to the
same extent that we are permitted to do; they are so
far off that the sun’s rays become greatly enfeebled
before they can traverse the distance; but the gloom
of their situation seems to matter but little, for it is
highly improbable that any of these bodies could be
inhabited.</p>

<p>A view of parts of the paths of these four great
planets is shown in <a href="#ifig_65">Fig. 65</a>. The innermost is Jupiter,
which completes a circuit in about twelve years; then
comes Saturn, revolving in an orbit so great that
twenty-nine years and a half are required before the
complete journey is finished. Still further outside is
Uranus, which has a longer journey than Saturn, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
moves so much more slowly that a man would have
to live to the ripe old age of eighty-four if a complete
revolution of Uranus was to be accomplished during
his lifetime. At the boundary of our system revolves
the planet Neptune, and though it is a mighty globe,
yet we cannot see it without a telescope. It is invisible
to the naked eye for two reasons: first of all, because
it is so far from the sun that the light which illuminates
it is excessively feeble; and, secondly, because it is so
far from us that whatever brilliancy it has is largely
reduced.</p>

<h3>JUPITER.</h3>

<p>Of all these bodies Jupiter is by far the greatest;
he is, indeed, greater than all the other planets rolled
into one. The relative insignificance of the earth when
compared with Jupiter is well illustrated by the fact
that if we took 1200 globes each as big as our earth,
and made them into a single globe, it would only be
as large as the greatest of the planets. A view of the
comparative sizes of the earth and Jupiter is shown in
<a href="#ifig_66">Fig. 66</a>.</p>

<div id="ifig_66" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 19em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 66.</span>—Jupiter and the Earth compared.</div></div>

<p>Fig. 67 shows a picture of Jupiter as seen through
the telescope. First, you will notice that the outline of
the planet’s shape is not circular, for it is plain that the
vertical diameter in this picture is shorter than the
horizontal one; in fact, Jupiter is flattened at the Poles
and bulges out at the equator, so that a section through
the Poles is an ellipse. Jupiter is turning round rapidly
on his axis, and this will account for the protuberance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
We find that the planet has assumed almost the same
form as if it were actually a liquid. This we can
illustrate by a globe of oil which is poised in a mixture
of spirits of wine and water so carefully adjusted that
the oil has no tendency to rise or fall. As we make
the globe of oil rotate, which we can easily do by passing
a spindle through it, we see that it bulges out in the
form that Jupiter as well as other planets have taken.</p>

<div id="ifig_67" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img src="images/i_p215.jpg" width="377" height="352" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span>—The Clouds of Jupiter.</div></div>

<p>On the picture of the planets you will see shaded
bands. These are constantly changing their aspect, and
for a double reason. In the first place, they change
because Jupiter is rotating so quickly that in five hours
the whole side of the planet which is towards us has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
been carried out of sight. In another five hours the
original side of the globe will be back again, for the
entire rotation occupies about 10 hours, or, more precisely,
9 hours 55 minutes 21 seconds.</p>

<p>But these bands are themselves not permanent objects.
They have no more permanence than the clouds over
our own sky. Sometimes Jupiter’s clouds are more
strongly marked than on other occasions. Sometimes,
indeed, they are hardly to be seen at all. It is from
this we learn that those markings which we see when
we look at the great planet are merely the masses of
cloud which surround and obscure whatever may constitute
his interior.</p>

<p>There is a circumstance which demonstrates that
Jupiter must be an object exceedingly different from
the earth, though both bodies agree in so far as having
clouds are concerned. What would you think when I
tell you that we were able to weigh Jupiter by the aid
of his little moons, of which I shall afterwards speak?
These little bodies inform us that Jupiter is about 300
times as heavy as our earth, and we have no doubt
about this, for it has been confirmed in other ways.
But we have found by actual measurement that Jupiter
is 1200 times as big as the earth, and therefore, if he
were constituted like the earth, he ought to be 1200
times as heavy. This is, I think, quite plain; for if
two cakes were made of the same material, and one
contained twice the bulk of the other, then it would
certainly be twice as heavy. If there be two balls of
iron, one twice the bulk of the other, then, of course,
one has twice the weight of the other. But if a ball<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
of lead have twice the bulk of a ball of iron, then the
leaden ball would be more than twice as heavy as the
iron, because lead is the heavier material. In the same
way, the weights of the earth and Jupiter are not what
we might expect from their relative sizes. If the two
bodies were made of the same materials and in the
same state, then Jupiter would be certainly four times
as heavy as we find him to be. We are, therefore, led
to the belief that Jupiter is not a solid body, at least
in its outer portions. The masses of cloud which
surround the planet seem to be immensely thick, and
as clouds are, of course, light bodies in comparison with
their bulk, they have the effect of largely increasing the
apparent size of Jupiter, while adding very little to his
weight. There is thus a great deal of mere inflation
about this planet, by which he looks much bigger than
his actual materials would warrant if he were constituted
like the earth.</p>

<p>These facts suggest an interesting question. Why
has Jupiter such an immense atmosphere, if we may
so call it? The clouds we are so familiar with down
here on the earth are produced by the heat of the sun,
which beats down upon the wide surface of the ocean,
evaporates the water, and raises the vapor up to where
it forms the clouds. Heat, therefore, is necessary for
the formation of cloud; and with clouds so dense and so
massive as those on Jupiter, more heat would apparently
be necessary than is required for the moderate clouds
on this earth. Whence is Jupiter to get this heat?
Have we not seen that the great planet is far more
distant from the sun than we are? In fact, the intensity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
of the sun’s heat on Jupiter is not more than the twenty-fifth
part of what we derive from the same source. We
can hardly believe that the sun supplied the heat to
make those big clouds on the great planet; so we must
cast about for an additional source, which can only be
inside the planet itself. So far as his internal heat is
concerned, Jupiter seems to be in much the same condition
now as our earth was once, ages ago, before its
surface had cooled down to the present temperature.
As Jupiter is so much larger than the earth, he has
been slower in parting with his heat. The planet
seems not yet to have had time to cool sufficiently to
enable water to remain on his surface. Thus the internal
heat of the planet supplies an explanation of his
clouds. We may also remark that as the present condition
of Jupiter illustrates the early condition of our
earth, so the present condition of the earth foreshadows
the future reserved for Jupiter when he shall have had
time to cool down, and when the waters that now exist
in the form of vapor shall be condensed into oceans on
his surface.</p>

<h3>THE SATELLITES OF JUPITER.</h3>

<p>Every owner of a telescope delights to turn it on the
planet Jupiter, both for the spectacle the globe itself
affords him, and for a view of the wonderful system of
moons by which the giant planet is attended. Fortunately
the four satellites of Jupiter lie within reach of
even the most modest telescope, and their incessant
changes relative to Jupiter and each other give them a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
never-ending interest for the astronomer. Compared
with the torpid performance of our moon, which requires
a month to complete a circuit around the earth, Jupiter’s
moons are wonderfully brisk and lively. Nor are they
small bodies like the satellites of Mars, for the second
of Jupiter’s satellites is quite as big as our moon, and
the other three are very much larger. It is, however,
true that his satellites appear insignificant when compared
with Jupiter’s own enormous bulk.</p>

<p>The innermost of these little bodies flies right round
in a period of one day and eighteen or nineteen hours,
while the outermost of them takes a little more than a
fortnight—that is, rather more than half the time that
our moon demands for a complete revolution. Jupiter’s
satellites are too far off for us to see much with respect
to their structure or appearance even with mighty telescopes.
It is, of course, their great distance from us
that makes them look insignificant. They would, however,
be bright enough to be seen like small stars were
it not that, being so close to Jupiter, his overpowering
brightness renders such faint objects in his vicinity
invisible.</p>

<p>It was by means of the satellites of Jupiter that one
of the most beautiful scientific discoveries was made.
As a satellite revolves round the giant planet it often
happens that the little body enters into the shadow of
the great planet. No sunlight will then fall upon the
satellite, and as it has no light of its own, it disappears
from sight until it has passed through the shadow and
again receives sunlight on the other side. We can
watch these eclipses with our telescopes, and there can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
be no more interesting employment for a small telescope.
The movements of these bodies are now known so thoroughly
that the occurrence of the eclipses can be predicted.
The almanacs will tell when the satellite is
calculated to disappear, and when it ought again to
return to visibility. When astronomers first began to
make these computations a couple of hundred years
ago, the little satellites gave a great deal of trouble.
They would not keep their time. Sometimes they were
a quarter of an hour too soon, and sometimes a quarter
of an hour too late. At last, however, the reason for
these irregularities was discovered, and a wonderful
reason it was.</p>

<p>Suppose there were a number of cannons all over
Hyde Park, and that these cannons were fired at the
same moment by electricity. Though the sounds would
all be produced simultaneously, yet, no matter where
you stood, you would not hear them altogether; the
noise from the cannons close at hand would reach your
ears first, and the more distant reports would come in
subsequently. You can calculate the distance of a flash
of lightning if you allow a mile for every five seconds
that elapse between the time you saw the flash and the
time you heard the peal of thunder which followed it.
The light and the noise were produced simultaneously,
but the sound takes five seconds to pass over every mile,
while the light, in comparison to sound, may be said to
move instantaneously. That sound travelled with a
limited velocity was always obvious, but never until
the discrepancies arose about Jupiter’s satellites was it
learned that light also takes time to travel. It is true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
that light travels much more quickly than sound—indeed,
about a million times as fast. Light goes so
quickly, that it would rush more than seven times
around the earth in a single second. So far as terrestrial
distances are concerned, the velocity of light is
such that the time required for a journey is inappreciable.
The distances, however, between one celestial
body and another are so enormous, that even a ray of
light, moving as quickly as it alone can move, will
occupy a measurable time on the way. Our moon is
comparatively so near us, that light takes little more
than a second to cover that short distance. Eight minutes
are, however, required for light to travel from the
sun to the earth; in fact, the sunbeams that now come
into our eyes left the sun eight minutes ago. If the
sun were to be suddenly extinguished, it would still
seem to shine as brightly as ever in the eyes of the
inhabitants of this earth for eight minutes longer. As
Jupiter is five times as far from the sun as we are, it
follows that the light from the sun to Jupiter will spend
forty minutes on the journey, and the light from Jupiter
to the earth will take a somewhat similar time. When
we look at Jupiter and his moons, we do not see him as
he is now, we see him as he was more than half an hour
ago, but the interval will vary somewhat according to
our different distances from the planet. Sometimes the
light from Jupiter will reach us in as little as thirty-two
minutes, while sometimes it will take as much as
forty-eight—that is, the light sometimes requires for
its journey a quarter of an hour more than is sufficient
at other times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
We can therefore understand that irregularity of
Jupiter’s satellites which puzzled the early astronomers.
An eclipse sometimes appeared a quarter of an hour
before it was expected; because the earth was then as
near as it could be to Jupiter, while the calculations
had been made from observations when Jupiter was
at his greatest distance. It was these eclipses of the
satellites which first suggested the possibility that light
must have a measurable speed. When this was taken
into account, then the occasional delay of the eclipses
was found to be satisfactorily explained. Confirmation
flowed in from other sources, and thus the discovery of
the velocity of light was completely established.</p>

<p>Professor Barnard, when studying Jupiter in 1892
with the splendid refractor at the Lick Observatory,
saw a very small point of light nearer to the planet
than the nearest of the four satellites already known.
Further examination showed that this little object was
indeed another satellite. Thus Jupiter has a fifth moon
in addition to the four which have been known so long.
This little body is so small and faint that it can only
be discerned under the most favorable conditions by the
most powerful telescopes.</p>

<h3>SATURN.</h3>

<p>Next outside Jupiter, on the confines of the ancient
planetary system, revolves another grand planet, called
Saturn. His distance from us is sometimes nearly a
thousand millions of miles, and he requires more than
a quarter of a century for the completion of each revolution.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
Sometimes people do not pronounce the names
of the planets quite correctly. I have heard of a gardener
who has a taste for astronomy, and sometimes
begins to talk about the planets Juniper and Citron.
Probably you will know what he meant to say. The
ancients had discovered Saturn to be a planet, for
though he looked like a star, yet his movement through
the constellations could not escape their notice when
attention was paid to the heavens.</p>

<div id="ifig_68" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img src="images/i_p223.jpg" width="383" height="276" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 68.</span>—Saturn and the Earth compared.</div></div>

<p>In the matter of size Saturn is only surpassed by
Jupiter among the planets. He is about 600 times as
large as the earth; the small object, <span class="smcap smaller">E</span>, shown in <a href="#ifig_68">Fig. 68</a>,
represents our earth in its true comparative size to
the ringed planet; but Saturn is so far off, that even
at his best he is never so bright as Venus, or Mars,
or Jupiter become when they are favorably situated.
On the globe of Saturn we can sometimes see a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
bands, but they are faint compared with those on Jupiter.
There is, however, no doubt that what we see
upon Saturn is a dense mass of cloud. Indeed, he can
have comparatively little solid matter inside, for this
planet does not weigh so much as a ball of water the
same size would do. Saturn, like Jupiter, must be
highly heated in his interior.</p>

<p>The ring, or rather series of rings, by which the planet
is surrounded are also shown in <a href="#ifig_68">Fig. 68</a>: these appendages
are not fastened to the globe of Saturn by any
material bonds; they are poised in space, without any
support, while the globe or planet proper is placed symmetrically
in the interior.</p>

<p>I have made a model which shows Saturn with his
rings, but it is necessary for me to fasten the rings by
little pieces of wire to the globe, for there is no mechanical
means by which the rings of the model could be
poised without support, as they are around the planet.
If we throw the beam of the electric lamp on the little
planet, we see the shadow which the planet casts on its
ring. Similar shadows can be observed in the actual
Saturn of the sky, and this is a proof that the planet
does not shine by its own light, but by the light of the
sun which falls upon it. Here again we illustrate the
wide difference between a planet and a star, for were
our sun to be put out, Saturn and all the other planets
in the sky would vanish from sight, while the stars
would, of course, twinkle on as before. There are three
rings round Saturn; they all lie in the same plane, and
they are so thin, that when turned edgewise towards us
the whole system almost disappears, except in very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
powerful telescopes. The outer and the inner bright
rings are divided by a dark line, which can be traced
entirely round. At the inner edge of the inner ring
begins that strange structure called the <em>crape</em> ring,
which extends halfway towards the globe of the planet.
The most remarkable point about the crape ring is its
semi-transparency, for we can sometimes see the globe
of the planet through this strange curtain. The crape
ring can only be observed with a powerful telescope.
The other two rings are within the power of very moderate
instruments.</p>

<h3>THE NATURE OF THE RINGS.</h3>

<p>For the explanation of the nature of Saturn’s rings
we are indebted to the calculations of mathematicians.
You might have thought, perhaps, that nothing would
be simpler than to suppose the rings were stiff plates
made from solid material. But the question cannot be
thus settled. We know that the ring could not bear
the strain of the planet’s attraction upon it if it were a
solid body. I may illustrate the argument by familiar
facts about bridges. Where the span is but a small one,
as, for instance, when a road has to cross a railway, a
canal, or a river, the arch is, of course, the proper kind
of structure. There is, for example, a specially beautiful
arch over the river Dee at Chester. But if the
bridge be longer than this, masonry arches are not
suitable. Where a considerable span has to be crossed,
as at the Menai Straits, or a gigantic one, as at the
Firth of Forth, then arches have to be abandoned, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
iron bridges of a totally different construction have to
be employed. Arches cannot be used beyond a limited
span, because the strain upon the materials becomes too
great for their powers of resistance to withstand. Each
of the stones in an arch is squeezed by intense pressure,
and there is a limit beyond which even the stoutest
stones cannot be relied upon. As soon, therefore, as
the span of the arch is so great that the stones it contains
are squeezed as far as is compatible with safety,
then the limit of size for that form of arch has been
reached.</p>

<p>Suppose that you stood on Saturn at his equator,
and looked up at the mighty ring which would stretch
edgewise across your sky. It would rise up from the
horizon on one side, and, passing over your head, would
slope down to the horizon on the other. You would,
in fact, be under an arch of which the span was about
100,000 miles. Owing to the attraction of Saturn,
every part of that structure would be pulled forcibly
towards his surface, and thus the materials of the arch,
if it were a solid body, would be compressed with terrific
force.</p>

<p>It does not really signify that the arch I am now
speaking of is half of a ring the other half of which is
below the globe of the planet. That is only a difference
with respect to the support of two ends of the arch,
and does not affect the question as to the pressure upon
its materials; nor does the fact that the ring is revolving
remove the difficulty, though it undoubtedly lessens
it. We know no solid substance which could endure
the pressure. Even the toughest steel that ever was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
made would bend up like dough under such conditions.
We cannot, therefore, account for Saturn’s ring by supposing
it to be a solid, for no solid would be strong
enough.</p>

<p>Do you not remember the old fable of the oak tree
and the pliant reed—how when the storm was about
to arise the oak laughed at the poor reed, and said it
would never be able to withstand the blasts? But
matters did not so turn out. The mighty oak, which
would not yield to the storm, was blown down, while
the slender reed bent to the wind and suffered no
injury. This gives us a hint as to the true constitution
of Saturn’s ring; it is not a solid body, trying to
resist by mere strength; it is rather to be explained as
an excessively pliant structure. Indeed, I ought not
to call it a structure at all; it is rather a multitude of
small bodies not in the least attached together. I do
not know what the size of these bodies may be. For
anything we can tell, they may be no larger than the
pebbles you find on a gravel walk.</p>

<p>Let us see how we could encircle our earth with
rings like those which surround Saturn. I shall ask
you to be provided with a sufficiently large number of
pebbles, and you must also imagine that I have the
means of ascending high up into space, halfway from
here to the moon. Suppose I went up there and simply
dropped the pebble, of course, it would tumble straight
down to the earth again. If, however, I threw it out
with proper speed and in the proper direction, I could
start it off like a little moon, and it would go on round
and round our earth in a circle. I mention a pebble,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
but really it is little matter what the size of the object
may be—it may be as small as a grain of shot or as big
as a cannon-ball. Now take another pebble. Cast it
also in a somewhat similar path, taking care, however,
that the planes of the two orbits shall be the same.
Each of these little bodies shall pursue its journey
without interference from the other. Then proceed in
the same way with a third, a fourth, with thousands
and millions and billions of pebbles, until at last the
small bodies will become so numerous that they almost
fill a large part of the plane with a continuous shoal.
Each little object, guided entirely by the earth’s attraction,
will pursue its path with undeviating regularity.
Its neighbors will not interfere with it, nor will it interfere
with them. Let us circumscribe the limits of our
flat shoal of moonlets. We first take away all those
that lie outside a certain large circle; then we shall
clear away sufficient to make a vacant space between
the outer ring and the inner ring, and thus the two
conspicuous rings have been made; at the inside of the
inner ring we shall take out numbers of pebbles here
and there, so as to make this part much less dense
than the outer portions, and thus produce a semi-transparent
crape ring; then we shall clear away those that
come too close to the planet, and form a neat inner
boundary.</p>

<p>Could we then view our handiwork from the standpoint
of another planet, what appearance would our
earth present? The several pebbles, though individually
so small, would yet, by their countless numbers,
reflect the sun’s light so as to produce the appearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
of a continuous sheet. Thus we should find a large
bright outer ring surrounding the earth, separated by a
dark interval from the inner ring, and at the margin
of the inner ring the pebbles would be so much more
sparsely distributed that we should be able to see
through them to some extent. That beautiful system
of rings which Saturn displays is undoubtedly of a
similar character to the hypothetical system which I
have endeavored to describe. No other explanation
will account for the facts, especially for the semi-transparency
of the crape ring. The separate bodies from
which Saturn’s rings are constituted seem, however,
so small that we are not able to see them individually.
There are some other fine lines running round the
rings beside the great division, and these can also be
explained by the theory I have stated.</p>

<p>Saturn has other claims on our attention besides those
of its rings. It has an elaborate retinue of satellites—no
fewer, indeed, than nine; but some of them are very
faint objects, and not by any means so interesting as
the system by which Jupiter is attended. The ninth
of these was discovered quite recently by Professor
W. H. Pickering, of Harvard College Observatory.
This little moon, for which the name “Phoebe” has
been suggested, is further from the planet than any of
the others. It is a minute object shining as a star of
the 15th or 16th magnitude, and moves around the
planet in a period of about sixteen months.</p>

<p>Saturn was the last and outermost of the planets
with which the ancients were acquainted. Its path
lay on the frontiers of the then known solar system,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
and the magnificence of the planet itself, with its attendant
luminaries and its marvellous rings, rendered
it worthy indeed of a position so dignified. These five
planets—namely, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn—made up with the sun and the moon the seven
“planets” of the ancients. They were supposed to complete
the solar system, and, furthermore, the existence
of other members was thought to be impossible. In
modern times it has been discovered that there are yet
two more planets. I do not now refer to those little
bodies which run about in scores between Mars and
Jupiter. I mean two grand first-class planets, far
bigger than our earth. One of them is Uranus, which
revolves far outside Saturn, and the other is Neptune,
which is much further still, and whose mighty orbit
includes the whole planetary system in its circuit. To
complete its journey round the sun not less than 165
years is required.</p>

<h3>WILLIAM HERSCHEL.</h3>

<p>I have to begin the account of this discovery by telling
you a little story. In the middle of the last century
there lived at Hanover a teacher of music whose name
was Isaac Herschel. He had a family of ten children,
and he did the best for them that his scanty means
would permit. Of his children William was the fourth,
and he inherited his father’s talents for music, as did
most of his brothers and sisters. He was a bright,
clever boy at school, and he made such good progress
in his music that by the time he was fourteen years old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
he was able to play in the military band of the Hanoverian
Guards. War broke out between France and
England, and as Hanover was then under the English
crown, the French invaded it, and a battle was fought
in which the poor Hanoverian Guards suffered very
terribly. Young Herschel spent the night after the
battle in a ditch, and he came to the conclusion that he
did not like fighting, though he was only a member of
the band, and he resolved to change his profession.
That was not so easy to do just then, for even a bandsman
cannot leave the service in war time at his own
free will. William Herschel, however, showed all
through his life that he was not the man to be baffled
by difficulties. I do not know whether he asked for
leave, but at all events he took it. He deserted, in
fact, and his friends succeeded in sending him away to
England.</p>

<p>He was nineteen years old when he commenced to
look for a career over here, and certainly he found his
prospects in the musical profession very discouraging.
Herschel was, however, very industrious; and at last he
succeeded in getting appointed as organist of the Octagon
Chapel at Bath. He gradually became famous for
his musical skill, and had numbers of pupils. He used
also to conduct concerts and oratorios, and was well
known in this way over the West of England. Busy
as Herschel was with his profession, he still retained
his love of reading and study. Every moment he could
spare from his duties he devoted to his books. It was
natural that a musician should specially desire to study
the theory of music, and to understand it properly you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
should know Euclid and algebra, and, indeed, higher
branches of mathematics as well. Herschel did not
know these things at first; he had not the means of
learning them when he was a boy, so he worked very
hard after he became a man. And he studied with
such success that he made fair progress in mathematics,
and then it appeared to him that it would be interesting
to learn something about astronomy. After he had
begun to read about the stars, he thought he would
like to see them, and so he borrowed a telescope. It
was only a little instrument, but it delighted him so
much that he said he must have one for himself. So he
wrote to London to make inquiries.</p>

<p>Telescopes were much dearer in those days than they
are now, and Herschel could not give the price that the
opticians demanded. Here again his invincible determination
came to his aid. What was there to prevent
him from making a telescope? he asked himself; and
forthwith he began the attempt. You will think it
strange, perhaps, that a music-teacher who had no
special training as a mechanic should at once commence
so delicate and difficult a task; but it is not really so
hard to make a telescope as might be imagined. The
amateur cannot make such a pretty-looking instrument
as he is able to buy at the shops—the tubes will not be
so beautifully polished and the finish will be such as a
trained workman would be ashamed of—but the essential
part of a telescope is comparatively easy to make;
at least, I should say of a reflecting telescope, which is
the kind Herschel attempted to make, and succeeded in
making. You must know that there are two kinds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
telescopes. The commoner one with which you are more
familiar is called the refracting telescope, and it has
glass lenses. It was an instrument constructed on this
principle that we spoke of in a former lecture (<a href="#Page_97">p. 97</a>).
The reflecting telescope depends for its power upon a
bright mirror at the lower end, and when using this
instrument you look at the reflection of the stars in the
mirror. It was a reflector like this that Herschel began
to construct, and he engaged in the task with enthusiasm.
His sister Caroline had come to live with him,
and she used to help him at his work. So much in
earnest was he that he used to rush into his workshop
directly he came home from a concert, and without taking
off his best clothes he would plunge into the grinding
and polishing of his mirrors. His sister tried to
keep the house as tidy as possible, but Herschel put up
a carpenter’s shop in the drawing-room, and turning-lathes
in the best bedroom. At last he succeeded. He
made a mirror of the right shape, and found that it
exhibited the stars properly. It was not a looking-glass
in the ordinary sense, with glass on one side and
quicksilver on the other. The mirror that Herschel
constructed was entirely of metal. It consisted of a
mixture of two parts of copper with one of tin.</p>

<div id="ifig_69" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22em;">
  <img src="images/i_p234.jpg" width="339" height="105" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span>—The Mirror.</div></div>

<p>The copper has first to be melted in a furnace, for
the metal must be above a red heat before it will begin
to run. Then the tin has to be carefully added, and
the casting of the mirror is effected by pouring the
molten metal into a flat mould. Thus the rough mirror
is obtained, which in Herschel’s earlier telescopes seems
to have been about six or seven inches in diameter, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
nearly an inch thick. Though copper is such a tough
substance, and though tin is also tough, yet when melted
together to make speculum metal, as this alloy is called,
they produce an exceedingly hard and brittle material.
When we remember that we could never break a copper
penny piece by throwing it down on the flags, it may
seem strange that the “speculum metal” should be so
exceedingly brittle. A piece the size of a penny would
be more brittle than a bit of glass of the same dimensions,
and when the speculum is cast, unless it is cooled
very carefully, it will fly into pieces. Herein lay one
of the difficulties that Herschel encountered. Speculum
metal must be put into an oven as soon as the casting
has become solid, and then the heat is gradually allowed
to abate. When the speculum has been at last obtained,
next follows the labor of giving it the true figure and
polish. It is not only more fragile than glass, but it is
also quite as hard, and therefore the grinding is a tedious
operation. First the surface has to be ground with
coarse sand, and then with emery, which is gradually
made finer and finer until the true figure has been
given (<a href="#ifig_69">Fig. 69</a>). The mirror is then somewhat basin-shaped,
but the depression is very slight. For example,
in a mirror six inches across the depression at the centre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
would perhaps be not more than the twentieth of an
inch. Small though this depression is, yet it has to be
made with exactness. In fact, if it were wrong at any
point by so much as the tenth of the thickness of this
sheet of paper, the telescope would not perform accurately.
The tool that is used in grinding is made of
cast iron, and has been turned in a lathe to the right
shape. It is divided into squares
in the manner shown in <a href="#ifig_70">Fig. 70</a>.
After the grinding comes the
polishing, and this is effected with
a tool like the grinder in shape.
This has to be covered over with
little squares of pitch, so that when
warmed and put down on the
mirror it is soft enough to receive
the right shape. Some rouge
and water is spread over the mirror, and the polisher is
worked backward and forward with the hand until a
brilliant surface is obtained.</p>

<div id="ifig_70" class="figright" style="max-width: 12em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 70.</span>—The Grinding
Tool.</div></div>

<p>When the amateur astronomer has completed this
part of the task, all the great difficulties about his telescope
are conquered. The tube may be made of wood,
and, indeed, a square tube will do just as well as a
round one. He must also provide for the top of the
tube a small mirror, which has to be perfectly flat. The
preparation of this requires much care, because it is not
so easy as one might suppose to obtain an accurately
flat surface. One way of doing this is to get three
pieces, and grind each two of them together until every
pair will touch all over; then they will certainly all be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
flat. One more part you want, and that is an eyepiece.
This presents no difficulty. A single glass lens can be
made to answer and your telescope is complete.</p>

<h3>THE DISCOVERY OF URANUS.</h3>

<p>It was in the year 1774 that Herschel first had a
view of the heavens through the telescope he had himself
constructed. During the early part of his career
he does not seem to have made any important discoveries.
He was gradually preparing himself for the
great achievement by which his name became famous.</p>

<p>It was on the 13th of March, 1781, that the organist
of the Octagon Chapel at Bath turned his telescope
on the constellation of the Twins, and began to look at
one star after another. You must know that a star
merely looks like a little point in a telescope; even the
greatest instrument will only make a star look brighter,
and will never show it with a perceptible disk. In looking
over the stars that night, Herschel’s attention was
arrested by one object that did look larger when magnified,
and therefore was not a star. The only other
objects which would behave in this way were the
planets, or possibly a comet. Indeed, at first Herschel
imagined that what he saw must be a comet. It could
hardly have occurred to him that he was to have such
good fortune as to discover a new planet. The five
great planets had been known from all antiquity. Was
it reasonable to suppose that there could be yet another
that had never been perceived? Fortunately, there
was a test available. A star remains in the same place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
from night to night and from year to year; while a
planet, as we have already had occasion to mention, is
a body which is wandering about. The movements of
a planet are, however, not at all like those of a comet.
To decide on the nature of Herschel’s newly discovered
body, it was sufficient to observe the character of its
motion. A few nights sufficed to do this. The position
of the body was carefully marked relatively to the
neighboring stars, and it was soon shown that it was a
planet.</p>

<p>Here, then, a great discovery was made. A new
planet, now called Uranus, was added to our system.
It would be nothing to discover a new star. You might
as well talk of discovering a new grain of sand on the
seashore. The stars are in untold myriads. They
are so far off that they have no relation whatever to
our system, which is presided over by the sun. But
by the detection of a new planet, revolving far outside
Saturn, Herschel showed that a new and most interesting
member had to be added to the five old planets
which have been known from the earliest records of
history.</p>

<p>It may well be imagined that a discovery so startling
as this excited astonishment throughout the scientific
world. “Who is this Bath organist?” everybody asked.
Accounts of him and his discoveries appeared in the
papers. His fellow-citizens were not so familiar with
the name as we are, happily, now; and the spelling
of the unusual name showed many varieties. When
George III. heard of Herschel’s great achievement, he
directed the astronomer to be summoned to Windsor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
that the King might receive an account of the wonderful
discovery from the lips of the discoverer himself. Herschel
of course obeyed, and he brought with him his
famous telescope, and also a map of the whole solar
system, to show to the King. No doubt he thought
that his Majesty had probably not paid much attention
to astronomy. Herschel was, therefore, prepared to
explain to the King what it would be necessary for him
to know before he could fully appreciate the magnitude
of the discovery.</p>

<p>You will remember that Herschel while still a boy
had deserted from the army, many years previously.
It appears that the King had learned this fact in some
way, so that when Herschel was ushered into his presence
his Majesty said that before the great astronomer
could discuss science there was a little matter of business
that must be disposed of. The King accordingly
handed Herschel a paper, in which he was, I dare say,
greatly surprised to find a pardon to the deserter written
out by the King himself.</p>

<p>Then Herschel unfolded his wonderful discovery,
which the King thoroughly appreciated, and in the
evening the telescope was set up in the gardens, and
the glories of the heavens were displayed. Herschel
made a most favorable impression on his Majesty, and
when the King told the ladies of the Castle next day
of all that Herschel had shown him, their astronomical
ardor was also aroused, and they asked to see through
the marvellous tube. Of course Herschel was ready to
comply, and the telescope was accordingly carried to
the windows of the Queen’s apartments at Windsor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
which would have commanded a fine view if the clouds
had not been in the way, which they unfortunately
were. Even for royalty the clouds would not disperse,
so what was to be done? Herschel was equal to the
occasion. He specially wanted to exhibit Saturn, for it
is one of the most beautiful objects in the sky, and will
fascinate any intelligent beholder. No astronomers
would have been able to see Saturn through the clouds,
but Herschel did not disappoint his visitors; he directed
the instrument, not to the sky (nothing was there to be
seen); he turned it towards a distant garden wall. Now
what would you expect to see by looking through a
telescope at a garden wall—bricks, perhaps, or ivy?
What these ladies saw was a beautiful image of Saturn,
his globe in the centre and his rings all complete, forming
so true a resemblance to the planet that even an
experienced astronomer might have been deceived. In
the afternoon Herschel had seen that the clouds were
thick, and that there would be little probability of using
the telescope properly. Accordingly he cut out a little
image of Saturn, illuminated it by lamps, and set it up
at a suitable distance on a garden wall.</p>

<p>Herschel’s visit to Windsor was productive of important
consequences. The King said it was a pity that
so great an astronomer should devote himself to music,
and that it would be far better for him to give up that
profession and come and live at Windsor. His Majesty
promised that he would pay him a salary, and he also
undertook to provide the cost of erecting great telescopes.
His faithful sister Caroline came with him as
his assistant, and also received some bounty from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
King. From that moment Herschel renounced all his
musical business, and devoted himself to his great life-task
of observing the heavens.</p>

<p>He built telescopes of proportions far exceeding those
that had ever been then thought of. He used to stand
at night in the open air from dusk to dawn gazing down
the tube of his mighty reflector, watching the stars and
other objects in the heavens as they moved past. He
would dictate what he saw to Caroline, who sat near
him. It was her business to write down his notes and
to record the position of the objects which he was
describing. Sometimes, she tells us, the cold was so
great that the ink used to freeze in her pen when she
was at this work. Until he became a very old man,
Herschel devoted himself to his astronomical labors.
His discoveries are to be counted by thousands, though
not one of them was so striking or so important as
the detection of the new planet which first brought
him fame.</p>

<p>The question of a name for the addition to the sun’s
family had, of course, to be settled. Herschel had surely
a right to be heard at the christening, and as a compliment
to his Majesty he named the stranger the
Georgium Sidus. So, indeed, for a brief while, the
planet was actually styled. The Continental astronomers,
however, would not accept this designation; all
the other planets were named after ancient divinities,
and it was thought that the King of England would
seem oddly associated with Jupiter and Saturn; perhaps
also they considered that the British dominions,
on which the sun never sets, were already quite large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
enough, without further extension to the celestial
regions. Accordingly a consultation was held, the
result of which was that George III. was deprived
of his planetary honors, and the body was given the
name of Uranus, which, by universal consent, it now
bears.</p>

<p>The planet Uranus lies just on the verge of visibility
with the unaided eye. It can sometimes be glimpsed
like a faint star, and, of course, with a telescope it is
readily perceived. Many generations of astronomers
before Herschel’s time had been observing the heavens,
making maps of the stars, and compiling great catalogues
in which the places of the stars were accurately
put down. It often happened that Uranus came under
their notice, but it never occurred to them that what
seemed so like a star was really a planet. I have, no
doubt, said that Uranus looked unlike a star when
Herschel examined it; but then that was because
Herschel was a particularly skilful astronomer. To
an observer of a more ordinary type Uranus would
not present any very remarkable appearance, and would
be passed over merely as a small star. In fact, the
planet was thus observed not once or twice, but no
fewer than seventeen times, before the acute eye of
Herschel perceived its true character. On many previous
occasions the planet had been noted as a star by
astronomers who are in every way entitled to our
respect. It required a Herschel, determined to see
everything in the very best manner, to grasp the discovery
which eluded so many others.</p>

<p>When Uranus was observed on these former occasions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
and mistaken for a star, its place had been carefully put
down. These records are at present of the utmost use,
because they show the past history of the planet; and
they appear all the more valuable when we remember
that Uranus requires no less than eighty-four years to
accomplish a single revolution around the sun. Thus,
since the planet was discovered in 1781, it had completed
one revolution by 1865, and is now (1899) about
one-third of the way around another. The earlier
observations extend backwards almost 200 years, so
that altogether we have more or less information about
the movements of the planet during the completion of
two circuits and a half.</p>

<p>Uranus is a great deal bigger than the earth, as you
will see in the view of the comparative sizes of the
planets (<a href="#ifig_47">Fig. 47</a>). It appears to be of a bluish hue, but
we cannot tell whether it turns round on its axis, or
rather, I should say, we are not able to <em>see</em> whether it
turns round on its axis; for we can hardly doubt that
it does so.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that Uranus is at so great a distance
from the earth, we have been able to put this planet,
no less than the nearer ones, in the weighing scales, and
we assert with confidence that Uranus is fifteen times
as heavy as our earth. We are indebted to the satellites
for this information.</p>

<h3>THE SATELLITES OF URANUS.</h3>

<p>You must use a very good telescope to see the
satellites of Uranus. They are four in number, bearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
the names of Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon.
The innermost of these, Ariel, completes a journey
round the planet in two days and a half; Oberon, the
most distant, requires thirteen days and a half. A
planet is always tending to pull its satellite down, and
the satellite is kept from falling by the speed with
which it revolves. The heavier the planet, the faster
must its satellites go round. Thus, to take an illustration
from our own moon, we know that, if the earth
were to be made four times heavier than it is, the moon
would have to spin round twice as fast as it does, in
order to remain in the same orbit. The speed with
which the satellites of Uranus revolve accordingly
affords a measure of the mass of the planet. Were
Uranus heavier than he is, his satellites would revolve
more quickly than they do; were he lighter, the
satellites would take a longer period to go round.</p>

<p>Uranus also seems to be greatly swollen by clouds, in
the same manner as are both Jupiter and Saturn; in
fact, if our earth was as big as Uranus, it would weigh
four or five times as much as Uranus does. Hence we
are certain that Uranus must consist of materials less
dense on the whole than are those of which our earth is
made.</p>

<p>There is another singular circumstance connected
with the moons of Uranus. I have told you how every
body revolving round another by gravitation will describe
an ellipse; but, of course, there are many different
kinds of this curve, and some may be nearly circles.
There is nothing whatever to prevent a satellite from
revolving around its primary in an exact circle if it be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
started properly; that is, in the right direction and
with the right speed. All the four satellites of this
planet seem to revolve in circles so perfect that we can
make an accurate picture of this system with a pair of
compasses. It is further to be noticed that the four
circles seem to lie exactly in the same plane. The
orbits of the other great planets and of their satellites
lie in planes inclined at angles of less than 35° to the
ecliptic, the plane in which the earth moves. Here
again the satellites of Uranus are exceptional. The
plane in which they are contained stands up almost
squarely to the plane in which the motion of the planet
is performed. The moons of Uranus seem to have got
a twist, from some accidental circumstance for which
we are not able to account.</p>

<h3>THE DISCOVERY OF NEPTUNE.</h3>

<p>The boundaries of the solar system had been much
extended by the discovery of Uranus, but they were
destined to receive still further enlargement by the
detection of another vast planet, revolving far outside
Uranus, the orbit of which forms, according to our present
knowledge, the outline of the planetary system.</p>

<p>I have here to describe one of the greatest discoveries
that have ever been made. It is not the magnificence
of the outermost planet itself that I refer to,
though, indeed, it is bigger than Uranus. I am rather
thinking of the <em>way</em> in which the discovery was made.
I do not mean any disrespect to Herschel when I say
that the discovery of Uranus was chiefly a stroke of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
good fortune; but I may be permitted to describe it in
this manner by way of emphasizing as strongly as I can
how utterly different was the train of ideas which led
to the discovery of Neptune. Herschel merely looked
at one star after another till suddenly he dropped on
the planet, having beforehand not the slightest notion
that any such planet was likely to exist. But Neptune
was shown to exist before it was ever seen, and, in fact,
the man that first saw the planet, and knew it to be a
planet, was not the discoverer. This is rather a difficult
subject; and it would take you years of hard study
to be able to understand the train of reasoning by which
Neptune was found. I shall, however, make an attempt
to explain this matter sufficiently to give at least some
idea of the kind of problem that had to be solved.</p>

<p>You will remember that law of Kepler which tells us
that every planet moves round the sun in an ellipse.
If the planet be uninterfered with in any way and
guided only by the attraction of the sun, it will forever
continue to describe precisely the same ellipse without
the slightest alteration. It was ascertained that the
path which Uranus followed was not always regular.
The early observations of the planet, when it was mistaken
for a star, have here been of the utmost service.
They have indicated the ellipse which Uranus described
the last time it went round, and our modern observations
have taught us the path which the planet is at
present describing. These two ellipses are slightly different,
and the consequence is that, supposing we take
the observations of Uranus made 100 years ago, and
calculate from them where Uranus ought to be now, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
find that the planet is a little astray. Astronomers are
not accustomed to be wrong in such calculations, and
when discrepancies arise, the first thing to be done is to
see what has caused them. It is certain that the position
in which Uranus is found this very night, for
example, is not what it would have been had the sun
alone been guiding the planet. Perhaps you will think
that it is impossible for reliable computations to be
made about such matters; but I assure you they can,
and the very fact that the motion of Uranus appeared
to be irregular made it interesting to try and find out
the cause of the disturbance.</p>

<p>I have already explained, when speaking about Mars
(<a href="#Page_187">p. 187</a>), that there is an attraction between every two
bodies, but in the group of planets to which the earth
belongs the sun’s attraction is so much stronger than
any other force that all the movements are guided
mainly by it. Nevertheless it is true that not only does
the sun pull our earth and all the other planets as well,
but all the planets, including the earth, are pulling one
another. In fact, there is an incessant struggle going
on in the family party. Fortunately the sun is so
much more powerful than any other member, that he
keeps them all pretty well in order; and unless you
look very carefully you will not see the effects of the
little struggles that are going on between every pair of
the system. Our earth itself is pulled and swayed to
and fro by the actions of its brothers and sisters. It is
dragged perhaps a thousand or two thousand miles this
way by Jupiter, or it gets a good tug in the other
direction by Venus. Mars and Saturn also do their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
little best to force the earth away from its strict path.
However, our earth does not suffer much from these
irregularities. It pursues its route fairly enough, just
as a coach from London to Brighton will get safely to
its destination notwithstanding the fact that it has to
swerve a little from its path whenever it meets other
vehicles on the way, or when the coachman wishes to
avoid a piece of the road on which stones have been
freshly laid down.</p>

<p>The track followed by Uranus was found to be somewhat
irregular, like that of every other planet. Jupiter
gave it a pull, and so did Saturn, and at first it was
thought that the irregularities which were perceived
could be explained by the action of these planets, so
big and so well known. Here is a question for calculation;
it involves a very long and a very hard piece of
work, but it is possible to estimate how far each of the
other planets is capable of dragging Uranus from its
path. Is it not remarkable that by working out long
calculations we should be able to find what one planet
hundreds of millions of miles away was able to do to
another planet still further off, and not only for to-day
or yesterday, but for past time extending over more
than a century? If, however, you will listen to me a
little longer, I think I shall give you a proof that these
sums could be worked out correctly.</p>

<p>When the calculations had been made which showed
how much the known planets could disturb Uranus, it
was found that there were still some deviations of the
planet that remained unexplained. They were not large;
they only amounted to showing that the body was just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
a little astray from the spot where the calculations
indicated it should be. The rest of astronomy was so
perfect, and the law of attraction prevailed so universally,
that it was thought the law of attraction must
provide some way of explaining the behavior of Uranus.
He could not have left his track of his own accord;
therefore there must be some agency at work upon him
of which we did not know. What could this unknown
source of disturbance be? Every such trouble had
hitherto been found to be a consequence of the attraction
of gravitation; therefore there must be some
unknown body pulling at Uranus which no one had
ever seen. Where could it be? How was it to be
discovered? Such were the questions that were asked,
and they were answered in a most satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>First of all, what sort of body could it be that was
pulling Uranus? It is obvious that none of the stars
would be competent to produce so great an effect;
they are all so far off that they have nothing whatever
to say to any of the domestic matters in our little solar
system, which is simply a group by itself. It would be
more reasonable to suppose that there must be yet
another planet which nobody had ever recognized, but
which affected Uranus so as to account for his truant
behavior. To begin to search for this planet with telescopes
without some guidance would be futile; in fact,
astronomers had been scanning the heavens for planets
for nearly fifty years, and though several had been discovered,
they all belonged to the zone of little planets,
and none of them were big enough to pull Uranus about
appreciably. Of course, if all the stars could be blotted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
out of the sky, so that nothing but planets were left,
then, by sweeping the telescope over the heavens, every
planet that exists might be speedily found. The difficulty
is that the planets, which are either small or very
distant, look so like the stars that it is impossible to
recognize them among the millions of glittering points
in the sky. It was, however, hoped that the unknown
planet would be large enough to be visible in the telescope,
if only we knew exactly where to point it.</p>

<p>Two illustrious astronomers, Adams of Cambridge,
and Leverrier of Paris, both separately undertook an
astonishing piece of calculation. They tried to find
out the position of the unknown planet from the mere
fact that it deranged Uranus in a particular way. I
dare say many of those who are reading this book have
learned simple equations in algebra, and they have
worked such questions as to find the length of a pole,
half of which is in mud, a quarter in water, and ten
feet above the water. Those who know this much can
perhaps realize the problem that had to be solved in
trying to discover the unknown planet. So difficult a
question as this had to be solved in a way that your
masters would hardly allow you to use when working
your sums in algebra. I do not think they would let
you make a series of guesses. Let us try 20 feet, for
instance, as the length of the pole; that will make 10
feet in the mud, 5 feet in the water, and 5 feet outside.
This will not do; it is not enough; we must try again;
and after another guess or two, we see that a pole 40
feet long will exactly answer. We do not use this
method of guessing in algebra, because solving the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
simple equation is a much better method. Adams and
Leverrier found that to discover the unknown planet
was a question so very difficult, that they were obliged
to use a sort of guessing, but very intelligent guessing,
I need hardly assure you. They proceeded in this way
(<a href="#ifig_71">Fig. 71</a>). They would draw a circle outside the path
of Uranus, and then suppose that a planet was revolving
in that circle. Its effect upon Uranus would then
be calculated, and it would be found whether the observed
irregularities could be in this manner accounted
for. The first planet they tried was not the right one;
then they began again with another, until at last, after
many trials and much very hard work, they saw that
there might be a planet in a particular path far outside
Uranus, such that if this planet were of the right
weight and moving with the right speed, then it would
pull Uranus exactly in the way that astronomers had
observed it to be pulled. They found at last that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
could be little doubt about the matter; for this unknown
body would account for all the facts. Then, indeed,
they had solved their equation; they had found the
unknown.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 71.</span>—Orbits of Uranus and Neptune.</div></div>

<p>The two great astronomers had thus discovered a
planet, but as yet it was only a planet on paper. Those
who could judge of the subject had no doubt that the
planet was really in the sky; but just as you like to
prove that you have found the correct answer to your
sum, so people were naturally anxious to prove the truth
of this wonderful sum that Adams and Leverrier had
worked out. This was to be done by actually seeing
the planet of which the astronomers had asserted the
existence. Leverrier calculated that the new planet in
a certain night would be in a particular position on the
sky. Accordingly he wrote to Dr. Galle, of the observatory
at Berlin, requesting him on the evening in question
to point his telescope to the very spot indicated,
and there he would see a planet which human eyes had
never before beheld. Of course, Dr. Galle was only
too delighted to undertake so marvellous a commission.
The evening was fine; the telescope was opened; it
was directed towards the heavens; and there, in the
very spot which the calculations of Leverrier had indicated,
shone the beautiful little planet. At Cambridge
arrangements had also been made to search for the new
member of the solar system, in accordance with Professor
Adams’ calculations. There also the planet that
had given all this trouble to Uranus was brought to
light. At first it looked like a star, as all such planets
do; but that it was not a star was speedily proved, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
the two tests which are sure indications of a planet.
First the body was so moving that its position with
respect to the adjacent stars was constantly changing.
Then, when a strong magnifying power was placed on
the telescope, the little object was seen, not to be a
mere starlike point, but to expand into the little disk
which shows us we are not looking at a distant sun, but
at a world like our own.</p>

<p>Was not this truly a great discovery? Have we not
shown you how entitled the calculations of astronomers
are to our respect, when we find that they actually discovered
the existence of a majestic planet before the
telescope had revealed it? See also the greatly increased
interest that belongs to Herschel’s discovery of Uranus.
We can hardly imagine anything that would have given
more gratification to this old astronomer than to think
that his Uranus should have given rise to a discovery
even more splendid than his own. He died, however,
more than twenty years before this achievement.</p>

<p>The authorities who decide on such matters christened
the new planet Neptune; and this body wanders round
on the outskirts of our solar system, requiring for each
journey a period of no less than 165 years. The circle
thus described has a radius thirty times as great as that
of the earth’s track.</p>

<p>Neptune is altogether invisible to the unaided eye,
but it is sufficiently bright to have been occasionally
recorded as a star. Indeed, nearly fifty years before it
was actually discovered to be a planet it had been
included by the astronomer Lalande in a list of stars he
was observing. A curious circumstance was afterwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
brought to light. When reference was made to the
books in which Lalande’s observations were written,
it was found that he had observed this object twice,
namely, on May 8 and May 10, 1785. Of course, if
the object had indeed been a star its position on the
two days would have been the same, but being a planet
it had moved. When Lalande, on looking over his
papers, saw that the places of this supposed star were
different on the two nights, he concluded that he must
have made a mistake on the first night, and accordingly
treated the object as if the place on the 10th was the
right one. Just think how narrowly Lalande missed
making a discovery! Unhappily for his renown, he
took it for granted that one or both of his observations
were erroneous, and so they must have been if the
object had been a star. But they were both right; it
was the planet which had moved in the interval.</p>

<p>As Neptune is half as far again from the earth as
Uranus, we can hardly expect to learn much about the
actual nature of the planet. We do know that it has
four times the diameter of the earth, so that it exceeds
the earth in the same proportion that the earth is larger
than the moon.</p>

<p>Like the other great planets, Neptune is also enveloped
with copious clouds; in fact, it only weighs one-fifth
part as much as it would do if it were made of
materials as substantial as are those of the earth. Like
our earth, Neptune is attended by one moon, which
revolves round the planet in a little more than six
days.</p>

<p>The orbit of this great planet marks the boundary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
of our known system of planets. We have seen how
the five great planets of antiquity have been increased
in these modern days by the addition of two more,
Uranus and Neptune, while the discovery of a multitude
of small planets has given a further increase to the number
of the sun’s family. We have still some other
objects in our solar system to describe; some of them
are excessively big; these are the comets. Some of
them are exceedingly small; they are the shooting
stars. We shall talk about comets and shooting stars
in our next lecture.</p>

<h3>THE MOVEMENTS OF A COMET.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> planets are all massive globes, more or less flattened
at the Poles; but now we have to talk about a
multitude of objects of the most irregular shapes, and
of the most flimsy description. We call them <em>comets</em>,
and they exist in such numbers that an old astronomer
has said “there were more comets in the sky than
fishes in the sea,” though I think we cannot quite
believe him. There is also another wide difference
between planets and comets: planets move round in
nearly circular ellipses, and not only do we know where
a planet is to-night, but we know where it was a month
ago, or a hundred years ago, or where it will be in a
hundred years or a thousand years to come. All such
movements are conducted with conspicuous regularity
and order; but now we are to speak of bodies which
generally come in upon us in the most uncertain and
irregular fashion. They visit us we hardly know whence,
except that it is from outer space, and they are adorned
in a glittering raiment, almost spiritual in its texture.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
They are always changing their appearance in a baffling,
but still very fascinating manner. If an artist tries to
draw a comet, he will have hardly finished his picture
of it in one charming robe before he finds it arrayed in
another. The astronomer has also his complaints to
make against the comets. I have told you how thoroughly
we can rely on the movements of the planets,
but comets often play sad pranks with our calculations.
They sometimes take the astronomers by surprise, and
blaze out with their long tails just when we do not
expect them. Then by way of compensation they frequently
disappoint us by not appearing when they have
been most anxiously looked for.</p>

<p>After a voyage through space the comet at length
begins to draw in towards the central parts of our system,
and as it approaches the sun, its pace becomes
gradually greater and greater; in fact, as the body
sweeps round the sun the speed is sometimes 20,000
times faster than that of an express train. It is sometimes
more than 1000 times as fast as the swiftest of
rifle bullets, occasionally attaining the rate of 200 miles
a second. The closer the comet goes to the sun, the
faster it moves; and a case has been known in which a
comet, after coming in for an incalculable duration of
time towards the sun, has acquired a speed so tremendous,
that in two hours it has whirled round the sun and
has commenced to return to the depths of outer space.
This terrific outburst of speed does not last long. A
pace which near the sun is 20,000 times that of our
express trains diminishes to 10,000 times, to fifty times,
to ten times that pace; while in the outermost part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
its path the comet seems to creep along so slowly that
we might think it had been fatigued by its previous
exertions.</p>

<div id="ifig_72" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img src="images/i_p257.jpg" width="441" height="264" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 72.</span>—How the Comet’s Tail is disposed.</div></div>

<p>We have so often seen a stream of sparks stretching
out along the track of a sky-rocket, that we might naturally
suppose the tail of a comet streamed out along
its path in a somewhat similar manner. This would be
quite wrong. You see from <a href="#ifig_72">Fig. 72</a> that the tail does
not lie along the comet’s path, but is always directed
outwards from the sun. If you will draw a line from
the sun to the head of the comet and follow the direction
of the line, it shows the way in which the tail is
arranged. You will also notice how the tail of the
comet seems to grow in length as it approaches the
sun. When the comet is first seen, the tail is often a
very insignificant affair, but it shoots out with enormous
rapidity until it becomes many millions of miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
long by the time the comet is whirling round the sun.
Those glories soon begin to wane as the comet flies outward;
the tail gradually vanishes, and the wanderer
retreats again to the depths of space in the same undecorated
condition as that in which it first approached.</p>

<p>When a comet appears, it is always a matter of interest
to see whether it is an entirely new object, or whether
it may not be only another return of a comet which has
paid us one or more previous visits. The question then
arises as to how they are to be identified. Here we see
a wide contrast between unsubstantial bodies like comets
and the weighty and stately planets. Sketches of
the various planets or of the face of the sun, though
they might show slight differences from time to time,
are still always sufficiently characteristic, just as a photographic
portrait will identify the individual, even
though the lapse of years will bring some changes in
his appearance. But the drawing of a comet is almost
useless for identification. You might as well try to
identify a cloud or a puff of smoke by making a picture
of it. Make a drawing of a comet at one appearance,
and sketch particularly the ample tail with which it is
provided. The next time the comet comes round it
may very possibly have two tails, or possibly no tail at
all. We are therefore unable to place any reliance on
the comet’s personal appearance in our efforts to identify
it. The highway which it follows through the sky
affords the only means of recognition; for the comet, if
undisturbed by other objects, will never change its actual
orbit. But even this method of identification often
fails, for it not unfrequently happens that during its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
erratic movements the comet gets into fearful trouble
with other heavenly bodies. In such cases the poor
comet is sometimes driven so completely out of its road
that it has to make for itself an entirely new path, and
our efforts to identify it are plunged in confusion. It
has happened that a second comet or even a third will
be found in nearly the same track, but whether these
are wholly different, or whether they are merely parts
of the same original object, it is often impossible to
determine.</p>

<p>The great majority of comets are only to be seen
with a telescope, and hardly a year passes without the
detection of at least a few of these faint objects. The
number of really brilliant comets that can be seen in a
lifetime could, however, be counted on the fingers.</p>

<h3>ENCKE’S COMET.</h3>

<p>We have already alluded to a little body called
Encke’s comet, which was discovered by an astronomer
at Marseilles. It was in the year 1818 that he was
scanning the heavens with a small telescope, when an
object attracted his attention. It was not one of those
grand long-tailed comets which every one notices; this
body was so faint that it merely appeared as a very
small cloud of light, and was recognized as a comet by
the fact that it was moving. It happens that there are
other bodies in the sky very like comets; we call them
nebulæ, and we shall have something to say about them
afterwards. But it is remarkable that just as a planet
is liable to be mistaken for a star, so a comet is liable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
to be mistaken for a nebula. However, in each case
the fact of its movement is the test by which the planet
or the comet is at once detected. A nebula stays
always in the same spot, like a star, while a comet is
incessantly moving. In fact, with a telescope you can
actually watch a comet stealing past the stars that lie
near it. You know that an object a very long way off
may appear to move slowly, though in reality it is moving
very rapidly. Look at a steamer near the horizon
at sea. In the course of a minute or two it will not
appear to have shifted its position to any appreciable
extent, but that is because it is far off. If you were
near the ship, you would see that it was dashing along
at the rate of perhaps fifteen or twenty miles an hour.
In a similar manner the comet seems to move slowly,
because it is at such a great distance. As a matter of
fact it is moving faster at the time we see it than any
steamer, faster than any express train, faster than any
cannon-ball. There were special reasons why the movements
of Encke’s comet should be watched with peculiar
care, and the track which it pursued be ascertained. If
you can observe a comet three times and measure its
position in the sky, the movement of that comet is
completely determined. Perhaps I should say would
be determined if the comet were let alone, which, unfortunately,
is not often the case. Indeed, you may
remember how I told you some of the misadventures
of this very comet when we were speaking about the
planet Mercury. Encke’s comet comes round in a period
of a little more than three years, and it gives us some
curious information that has been ascertained during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
its journeys. One of the facts we have thus learned is
so important that we cannot omit to notice it (<a href="#ifig_73">Fig. 73</a>).</p>

<div id="ifig_73" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 33em;">
  <img src="images/i_p261.jpg" width="523" height="526" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 73.</span>—The Orbit of Encke’s Comet.</div></div>

<p>At increasing heights above the earth’s surface there
is gradually less and less air; until at last, at about
200 or 300 miles above the surface on which we dwell,
there would be none. You might as well try to quench
your thirst by drinking out of an empty cup as attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
to breathe in the open space which begins a few hundred
miles aloft. In open space motion could take
place quite freely. Down here the resistance of the
air is a great impediment to movement, especially when
very rapid. A heavy cannon-ball is checked and robbed
of its pace by having to plough its way through our
dense atmosphere. The motion is arrested in the same
way, though not of course to the same degree, as if the
cannon-ball had been fired into water. Unsubstantial
objects are, of course, impeded by the air to a far
greater extent than such heavy bodies as cannon-balls.
You know that you cannot throw a handful of feathers
across the road in the same way that you could throw
a handful of gravel. The light feathers cannot force
their way through the air so well as the pebbles. A
body so flimsy as a comet would never be able to push
its way through an atmosphere like ours; but out in
empty space the comet meets with no resistance during
the greater part of its path. Accordingly, though it has
little more substance than a will-o’-the-wisp, the comet
pursues its journey with as much resolute dignity as
if it were made of cast iron. If in any part of its track
the body should have to pierce its way through any
material like even the thinnest possible air, then the
unsubstantial nature of the cometary materials would
be at once shown. The motion would be impeded, and
the body’s path would be changed. In this way a comet
may be made very instructive, for it will show whether
space is really so empty as we sometimes suppose it to
be. During the greater part of its course the flimsy
little Encke tears along with such ease and speed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
there seems to be nothing to impede it, and thus we
learn that space is generally empty. However, when
the comet begins to wheel around the sun, the freedom
of its movements seems to receive a check. The unsubstantial
object has to force its way with a difficulty
that it did not experience so long as it was moving
round the greater part of its orbit. We thus learn that
there is a thin diffused atmosphere surrounding the sun.
We cannot, indeed, say that it is like our air. Its composition
is quite different, and almost the only way we
know of its existence is by the evidence which this
comet affords. In a former lecture I showed how
Encke’s comet told us the mass of the planet Mercury.
Now we see how the travels of the same body give us
information about the sun himself. I ought, however,
to add that some more recent observations seem not to
have confirmed the belief that there is the resistance of
the kind we have just been considering.</p>

<h3>THE GREAT COMET OF HALLEY.</h3>

<p>I dare say you would think it more interesting to
talk about some big and bright comets rather than
about objects so faint as that of Encke. It unfortunately
happens that most of the fine comets pay our
system only a single visit. There is only one of the
really splendid objects of this kind that comes back to
us with anything like regularity.</p>

<p>It was last seen in the year 1835, and I am glad to
tell you that it is coming again; it is expected about
the year 1910. You may ask, How can we feel sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
that such a prediction as I have mentioned will turn
out correctly? The fact is that this comet has been
watched for a great many centuries. We find ancient
records, some of them nearly 2000 years old, of the
appearance of grand comets, and several of these are
found to fit in with the supposition that there is a
body which accomplishes its journey in a period of
about seventy-five or seventy-six years. Of course there
are thousands of other comets recorded in these old
books as well; but what I mean is that among the
records many are found which clearly indicate some
successive returns of this particular body.</p>

<p>I will explain how the movements of this comet
were discovered. There was a great astronomer called
Halley, who lived two hundred years ago, and in the
year 1682 he, like every one else, was looking with
admiration at a splendid comet with a magnificent tail
which adorned the sky in that year. At the observatories,
of course, they diligently set down the positions
of the comet, which they ascertained by carefully
measuring it with telescopes. Halley first calculated
the highway which this comet followed through the
heavens, and then he looked at the list of old comets
that had been seen before. He thus found that in
1607—that was, seventy-five years earlier—a great
comet had also appeared, the path of which seemed
much the same as that which he found for the body
that he had himself observed. This was a remarkable
fact, and it became still more significant when he
discovered that seventy-six years earlier—namely, in
1531—another great comet had been recorded, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
moved in a path also agreeing with those of 1607 and
1682. It then occurred to Halley that possibly these
were not three different objects, but only different
exhibitions of one and the same, which moved round
in the period of seventy-five or seventy-six years.</p>

<p>There is a test which an astronomer can often apply
in the proof of his theory, and it is a very severe test.
He will not only show himself to be wrong if it fails,
but he will also make himself somewhat ridiculous.
Halley ventured to submit his reputation to this ordeal.
He prophesied that the comet would appear again in
another seventy-five or seventy-six years. He knew
that he would, of course, be dead long before 1758
should arrive; but when he ventured to make the
prediction, he said that he hoped posterity would not
refuse to admit that this discovery had been made by
an Englishman.</p>

<p>You can easily imagine that as 1758 drew near, great
interest was excited among astronomers to see if the
prediction of Halley would be fulfilled. We are
accustomed in these days to find many astronomical
events foretold with the same sort of punctuality as we
expect in railway time-tables. The Nautical Almanac
is full of such prophecies, and we find them universally
fulfilled. Even now, however, we are not able to set
forth our time-tables for comets with the same confidence
that we show when issuing them for the sun, the moon,
or the stars. How astonishing, then, must Halley’s
prediction have seemed! Here was a vast comet which
had to make a voyage through space to the extent
of many hundreds of millions of miles. For three-quarters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
of a century it would be utterly invisible in the
greatest telescopes, and the only way in which it could
be perceived was by figures and calculations which
enabled the mind’s eye to follow the hidden body all
around its mysterious track. For fifty, or sixty, or
seventy years nothing had been seen of the comet, nor,
indeed, was anything expected to be seen of it; but as
seventy-one, and seventy-two, and seventy-three years
had passed, it was felt that the wanderer, though still
unseen, must be rapidly drawing near. The problem
was made more difficult for those skilful mathematicians
who essayed to calculate it by the fact that the comet
approached the thoroughfares where the planets circulate;
and, of course, the flimsy object would be pulled
hither and thither out of its path by the attractions of
the weighty bodies. It was computed that the influence
of Saturn alone was sufficient to delay the comet for
more than three months, while it appeared that the
attraction of Jupiter was potent enough to retard the
expected event for a year and a half more. Was it not
wonderful that mathematicians should be able to find out
all these facts from merely knowing the track which
the comet was expected to follow? Clairaut, who
devoted himself to this problem, suggested that there
might also be some disturbances from other causes of
which he did not know, and that consequently the
expected return of the comet might be a month wrong
either way. Great indeed was the admiration in astronomical
circles when, true to prediction, the comet
blazed upon the world within the limits of time Clairaut
had specified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
The remarkable fulfilment of this prophecy entitles
us to speak with confidence about the past performances
of this comet. Among all the apparitions of Halley’s
comet for the last two thousand years, perhaps the most
remarkable is that which took place in the year 1066.
I am sure you will all remember this date in your
English history; it was the year of the Conquest. In
those days they did not understand astronomy as we
understand it now; they used to think of a comet as
a fearful portent of evil, sent to threaten some frightful
calamity; such as a pestilence, a war, a famine, or
something else equally disagreeable. Hence in the year
of the Conquest the appearance of so terrific an object
in the sky was a very significant omen. Attention was
concentrated upon the spectacle, and a picture of Halley’s
comet as it appeared to the somewhat terrified imaginations
of the people of those days has been preserved.
There is a celebrated tapestry at Bayeux on which
historical incidents are represented by beautifully worked
pictures. On this fabric we have a view of Halley’s
comet in a quaint and rather ludicrous aspect. You
will read of this comet also in the early pages of Tennyson’s
“Harold.”</p>

<h3>HOW THE TELEGRAPH IS USED FOR COMETS.</h3>

<p>In these days the study of comets is prosecuted with
energy. Over the world observatories are situated, and
whenever a comet is discovered, tidings of the event
are diffused among those likely to be interested. Suppose
that one is discovered in the southern hemisphere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
the astronomers then write to warn the northern
observatories of the event. But comets often move
faster than her Majesty’s mails, so that the telegraph
has to be put into requisition. The kind of message is
one which shall show the position and the movements of
the body. It necessarily involves a good many figures
and words, and consequently it is desirable to abbreviate
as much as possible for the sake of economy. There is
a further difficulty in using the telegraph, because the
messages are not of an intelligible description to those
not specially versed in astronomy. Skilful as the
telegraph clerks are, they can hardly be expected to be
familiar with the technicalities of astronomers. The
clerk at the receiving end is handed a message which
he does not understand very clearly. The clerk at the
other end does not understand the message which is
delivered to him, and between them it has happened
that they have transformed the message into something
which not only they do not understand, but which,
unfortunately, nobody else can understand either.
These difficulties have been surmounted by an agreement
between astronomers, which is so simple and
interesting that I must mention it.</p>

<p>The kind of message that expresses the place of a
comet will consist of sentences something of this
kind: “One hundred and twenty-three degrees and
forty-five minutes.” Surely it would be an advantage
to be able to replace all these words by a single word,
particularly if by doing so the risk of error would be
diminished. This is what the astronomers’ telegraphic
arrangement enables them to accomplish. There is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
certain excellent Dictionary known as Worcester’s. I
am sure when Mr. Worcester arranged this work, he
had not the slightest anticipation of an odd use to which
it would occasionally be put. Every astronomer who
is co-operating in the comet scheme must have a copy
of the book. To send the message I have just referred
to, he has to take up his Dictionary and look out page
123. Then he will count down the column until he
comes to the forty-fifth word on that page, which he
finds to be “constituent,” and according to this plan
the message, or at least this part of it, is merely that
one word, “constituent.” The astronomer who receives
this message and wishes to interpret it takes up his copy
of Worcester’s Dictionary and looks out for “constituent.”
He sees that it is on page 123, and that it is the
forty-fifth word down on that page; and therefore he
knows that the interpretation of the message is to be
one hundred and twenty-three degrees and forty-five
minutes.</p>

<h3>THE PARABOLA.</h3>

<p>Generally speaking, great comets come to us once
and are then never seen again. Such bodies do not
move in closed ovals or ellipses, they follow another
kind of curve, like that represented in <a href="#ifig_74">Fig. 74</a>. It is
one that every boy ought to know. In fact, in one of
his earliest accomplishments he learned how to make a
parabola. It is true he did not call it by any name so
fine as this, but every time a ball is thrown into the air
it describes a part of the beautiful curve which geometers
know by this word (<a href="#ifig_74">Fig. 74</a>). In fact, you could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
not throw a ball so that it should describe any other
curve except a parabola. No boy could throw a
stone in a truly horizontal line. It will always curve
down a little, will always, in fact, be a portion of a
parabola.</p>

<div id="ifig_74" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img src="images/i_p270.jpg" width="427" height="263" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 74.</span>—The Path of a Projectile is a Parabola.</div></div>

<p>There are big parabolas and there are small ones.
One of the shells which are thrown into a town when
bombarded from a distance describes, as it rises and then
slopes down again, part of a mighty parabola. So does
a tennis ball thrown by the hand or struck by the racket;
though here, indeed, I admit that a spin may be given
to the ball which will somewhat detract from the simplicity
of its movement. In playing baseball, a large
part of the skill of the pitcher consists in throwing the
ball in such a way that it shall not move in a parabola,
but in some twisting curve by which he hopes to baffle
his adversary. Setting aside these exceptions, and such
another as the case of a body tossed straight up or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
dropped straight down, we may assert that the path of
a projectile is a parabola.</p>

<div id="ifig_75" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_p271.jpg" width="390" height="327" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 75.</span>—The Lighthouse Reflector.</div></div>

<p>There are some remarkable applications of the same
curve for practical purposes. From our lighthouses we
want to send beams off to sea, so as to guide ships into
port. If we merely employed a lamp without concentrating
its rays, we should have a very imperfect lighthouse,
for the lamp scatters light about in all directions.
Much of it goes straight up into the air, much of it
would be directed inland; in fact, there is only an
extremely small part of the entire number of rays that
will naturally take the useful direction. We therefore
require something round the lamp which shall catch
the truant rays that are running away to idleness and
loss, and shall concentrate them into the direction in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
which they will be useful to the mariner. An effective
way of doing this is to furnish the lamp with a reflector.
On its bright surface (<a href="#ifig_75">Fig. 75</a>) all the rays fall which
would otherwise have gone astray, and each of them is
properly redirected, where the sailors can see it. It is
essential that the mirror shall do this work accurately,
and this it will only do when it has been truly shaped
so as to be a parabola.</p>

<p>You will remember, also, how I described to you
the reflector which Herschel made for his great telescope.
The shape of the mirror must be most accurately
worked, and it, too, must have a parabola for its
section; so that you see this curve is one of importance
in a variety of ways.</p>

<p>But the grandest of all parabolas are those which
the comets pursue. Unlike the ellipse, the parabola
is an open curve; it has two branches stretching away
and away forever, and always getting further apart.
Of course, in the examples of this curve that I have
given it is only a small part of the figure that is concerned.
When you throw a stone it only describes that
part of the parabola that lies between your hand and
the spot where the stone hits the ground. It is just a
part of the curve in the same way that a crescent may
be a bit of a circle. It is to comets that we must look
for the most complete illustration of the ample extent
of a parabola.</p>

<p>The shape of this grand curve will explain why so
many comets only appear to us once. It is quite clear
that if you begin to run round a closed racecourse, you
may, if you continue your career long enough, pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
and repass the starting-post thousands of times. Thus,
comets which move in ellipses, and are consequently
tracing closed curves, will pass the earth times without
number. For this reason we may see them over and
over again, as we do Encke’s comet or Halley’s comet.
But suppose you were travelling along a road which,
no matter how it may turn, never leads again into
itself, then it is quite plain that, even if you were to
continue your journey forever, you can never twice
pass the same house on the roadside. That is exactly
the condition in which most of the comets are moving.
Their orbits are parabolas which bend round the sun;
and, generally speaking, the sun is very close to the
turning-point. The earth is also, comparatively speaking,
close to the sun; so that while the comet is in that
neighborhood we can sometimes see it. We do not see
the comet for a long time before it approaches the sun,
or for a long time after it has passed the sun. All we
know, therefore, of its journey is that the two ends of
the parabola stretch on and on forever into space. The
comet is first perceived coming in along one of these
branches to whirl round the sun; and after doing so,
it retreats along the other branch, and gradually sinks
into the depths of space.</p>

<p>Why one of these mysterious wanderers should
approach in such a hurry, and then why it should
fly back again, can be partially explained without the
aid of mathematics.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that, at a distance of thousands of
millions of miles, there floated a mass of flimsy material
resembling that from which comets are made. Notwithstanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
its vast distance from the sun, the attraction
of that great body will extend thither. It is true the
pull of the sun on the comet will be of the feeblest and
slightest description, on account of the enormously great
distance. Still, the comet will respond in some degree,
and will commence gradually to move in the direction
in which the sun invites it. Perhaps centuries, or perhaps
thousands, or even tens of thousands, of years will
elapse before the object has gained the solar system.
By that time its speed will be augmented to such a
degree, that after a terrific whirl around the sun, it
will at once fly off again along the other branch of the
parabola. Perhaps you will wonder why it does not
tumble straight into the sun. It would do so, no doubt,
if it started at first from a position of rest; generally,
however, the comet has a motion to begin with which
would not be directed exactly to the luminary. This it is
which causes the comet to miss actually hitting the sun.</p>

<p>It may also be difficult to understand why the sun
does not keep the comet when at last it has arrived.
Why should the wandering body be in such a hurry
to recede? Surely it might be expected that the
attraction of the sun ought to hold it. If something
were to check the pace of the comet in its terrific
dash round the sun, then, no doubt, the object would
simply tumble down into the sun and be lost. The
sun has, however, not time to pull in the comet when
it comes up with a speed 20,000 times that of an
express train. But the sun does succeed in altering
the <em>direction</em> of the motion of the comet, and the
attraction has shown itself in that way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
I can illustrate what happens in this manner. Here
is a heavy weight suspended from the ceiling by a wire;
it hangs straight down, of course, and there it is kept
by the pull of the earth. Supposing I draw the weight
aside and allow it to swing to and fro, then the motion
continues like the beat of a pendulum. The weight is
always pulled down as near to the earth as possible,
but when it gets to the lowest point, it does not stay
there, it goes through that point, and rises up at the
other side. The reason is that the weight has acquired
speed by the time it reaches the lowest point; and that,
in virtue of its speed, it passes through the position in
which it would naturally rest, and actually ascends the
other side in opposition to the earth’s pull, which is
dragging it back all the time. This will illustrate how
the comet can pass by and even recede from the body
which is continually attracting it.</p>

<p>Just a few words of caution must be added. Suppose
you had an ellipse so long that the comet would take
thousands and thousands of years to complete a circuit,
then the part of the ellipse in which the comet moves
during the time when we can see it is so like a parabola,
that we might possibly be mistaken in the matter.
In fact, a geometer will tell us that if one end of an
ellipse was to go further and further away, the end
that stayed with us would gradually become more
and more like this curve. Therefore, some of those
comets which seem to move in parabolas may really
be moving in extremely elongated ellipses, and thus,
after excessively long periods of time, may come back
to revisit us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>

<h3>THE MATERIALS OF A COMET.</h3>

<p>A comet is made of very unsubstantial material.
This we can show in a very interesting manner, when
we see it moving over the sky between the earth and
the stars. Sometimes a comet will pass over a cluster
of very small stars, so faint that the very lightest cloud
that is ever in the sky would be quite sufficient to hide
them. Yet the stars are distinctly visible right through
the comet, notwithstanding that it may be hundreds of
thousands of miles thick. This shows us how excessively
flimsy is the substance of a comet, for while
a few feet of haze or mist suffice to extinguish the
brightest of stars, this immense curtain of comet stuff,
whatever it may be made of, is practically transparent.</p>

<p>I have often told you that we are able to weigh the
heavenly bodies, but a comet gives us a great deal of
trouble. You see that the weighing machine must be
of a very delicate kind if you are going to weigh a very
light object. Take, for example, a little lock of golden
hair, which no doubt has generally a value quite independent
of the number of grains that it contains. Suppose,
however, that we are so curious as to desire to
know its weight, then one of those beautiful balances
in our laboratories will tell us. In fact, if you snipped
a little fragment from a single hair, the balance would
be sensitive enough to weigh it. If, however, you were
only provided with a common pair of scales like those
which are suited for the parcel post, then you could
never weigh anything so light as a lock of hair. You
have not small enough weights to begin with, and even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
if you had they would be of no use, for the scale is too
coarse to estimate such a trifle. This is precisely the
sort of difficulty we experience when we try to weigh
a comet. The body, though so big, is very light, and
our scales are so cumbersome that we are in a position
of one who would try to weigh a lock of hair with a
parcel-post balance. We cannot always find suitable
scales for weighing celestial bodies. We have to use
for the purpose whatever methods of discovering the
weights happen to be available. So far, the methods
I have mentioned are of the rudest description; they
serve well enough for weighing heavy masses like
planets, but they will not do for such unsubstantial
bodies as comets.</p>

<p>But, though we fail in this endeavor, <i>i.e.</i> to weigh
comets, yet skilful astronomers have succeeded in something
which at first you might think to be almost
impossible. They have actually been able to discover
some of the ingredients of which a comet is made.
This is so important a subject that I must explain it
fully.</p>

<p>The most instructive comet which we have seen in
modern days is that which appeared in the year 1882.
It was an object so great that its tail alone was double
as long as from the earth to the sun. It was discovered
at the observatories in the southern hemisphere early in
September of that year. A little later it was observed
in the northern hemisphere in extraordinary circumstances.
It must be remembered that a comet is generally
a faint object, and that even those comets which
are large enough and bright enough to form glorious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
spectacles in the sky at night are usually invisible during
the brightness of day. For a comet to be seen in
daylight was indeed an unusual occurrence; but on
the forenoon of Sunday, September 17, Mr. Common
at Ealing saw a great comet close to the sun. Unfortunately
clouds intervened, and he was prevented from
observing the critical occurrence just approaching. An
astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope—Mr. Finlay—who
had also been one of the earliest discoverers of the
comet, was watching the body on the same day. He
followed it as it advanced close up to the sun; bright
indeed must that comet have been which permitted
such a wonderful observation. At the sun’s edge the
comet disappeared instantly; in fact, the observers
thought that it must have gone behind the sun. They
could not otherwise account for the suddenness with
which it vanished. This was not what really happened.
It was afterwards ascertained that the comet had not
passed behind the sun; it had, indeed, come between
us and our luminary. In its further progress this body
showed in a striking degree the incoherent nature of
the materials of which a comet is composed. It seemed
to throw off portions of its mass along its track, each
of which continued an independent journey. Even the
central part in the head of the comet—the nucleus, as
it is called—showed itself to be of a widely different
nature from a substantial planetary body. The nucleus
divided into two, three, four, or even five distinct parts,
which seemed, in the words of one observer, to be connected
together like pearls on a string.</p>

<p>The comet of 1882 was also very instructive with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
regard to the actual materials from which such bodies
are made. Astronomers have a beautiful method by
which they find out the substances present in a heavenly
body, even though they never can get a specimen of
the body into their hands. We know at least three
materials which were present in this comet. The first
of them is an ingredient which is very commonly found
in comets—a chemist calls it carbon. It is an extremely
familiar material on the earth; for instance,
coal is chiefly composed of carbon. Charcoal when
burned leaves only a few ashes. All the substance that
has vanished during combustion is carbon; in fact, it is
not too much to say that carbon is found abundantly
not only in wood, but in almost every form of vegetable
matter. The food we eat contains abundant carbon,
and it is an important constituent in the building up
of our own bodies. Generally speaking, carbon is not
found in a pure state—it is associated with other substances.
Soot and lampblack are largely composed of
it; but the purest form of this element carbon that we
know is the diamond.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that carbon is certainly found
as a frequent constituent of comets. The great comet
of 1882 undoubtedly contained it, as well as certain
other substances. Of these we know two: the first is
the element sodium, an extremely abundant material
on earth, inasmuch as the salt in the sea is mainly composed
of it. It was also discovered that the same great
comet contained another substance very common here
and extremely useful to mankind. Dr. Copeland and
Dr. Lohse at Dunecht showed that iron was present in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
this body which had come in to visit us from the depths
of space.</p>

<p>These discoveries are especially interesting because
they seem to show the uniformity of material composing
our system. We already knew that sodium and iron
abounded in the sun, and now we have learned that
these bodies and carbon as well are present in the
comets. In the next chapter we shall learn that the
very same materials—sodium and iron—are met with
in bodies far more remote from us than any bodies of
our own system.</p>

<p>Comets have such a capricious habit of dashing into
the solar system at any time and from any direction,
that it is worth while asking whether a comet might
not sometimes happen to come into collision with the
earth. There is nothing impossible in such an occurrence.
There is, however, no reason to apprehend that
any disastrous consequences would ensue to the earth.
Man has lived on this globe for many, many thousands
of years, and the rocks are full of the remains of fossil
animals which have flourished during past ages; indeed,
we cannot possibly estimate the number of millions of
years that have elapsed since living things first crawled
about this globe. There has never been any complete
break in the succession of life, consequently during all
those millions of years we are certain that no such dire
calamity has happened to the earth as a frightful collision
would have produced, and we need not apprehend
any such catastrophe in the future.</p>

<p>I do not mean, however, that harmless collisions with
comets may not have occasionally happened; in fact,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
there is good reason for knowing that they have actually
taken place. In the year 1861 a fine comet appeared;
and it is not so well remembered as its merits deserve,
because it happened, unfortunately for its own renown,
to appear just three years after the comet of 1858,
which was one of the most gorgeous objects of this kind
in modern times. But in 1861 we had a novel experience.
On a Sunday evening in midsummer of that
year, we dashed into the comet, or it dashed into us.
We were not, it is true, in collision with its densest
part; it was rather the end of the tail which we
encountered. There were, fortunately, no very serious
results. Indeed, most of us never knew that anything
had happened at all, and the rest only learned of the
accident long after it was all over. For a couple of
hours that night it would seem that we were actually
in the tail of the comet, but so far as I know no one
was injured or experienced any alarming inconvenience.
Indeed, I have only heard of one calamity arising from
the collision. A clergyman tells us that at midsummer
he was always able in ordinary years to read his sermon
at evening service without artificial light. On this
particular occasion, however, the sky was overcast with
a peculiar glow, while the ordinary light was so much
interfered with that the sexton had to provide a pair of
candles to enable him to get through the sermon. The
expense of those candles was, I believe, the only loss to
the earth in consequence of its collision with the comet
of 1861.</p>

<div id="ifig_76" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_p282.jpg" width="393" height="336" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 76.</span>—How the Tail of a Comet arises.</div></div>

<p>The tail of a comet appears to develop under the
influence of the sun. As the wandering body approaches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
the source of central heat it grows warm, and as it gets
closer and closer to the sun, the fervor becomes greater
and greater, until sometimes the comet experiences a
heat more violent than any we could produce in our
furnaces. The most infusible substances, such as stones
or earth, would be heated white-hot and melted, and
even driven off into vapor, under the intense heat to
which a comet is sometimes exposed. Comets, indeed,
have been known to sweep round the sun so closely as
to pass within a seventh part of its radius from the
surface. It seems that certain materials present in the
comet, when heated to this extraordinary temperature,
are driven away from the head, and thus form the tail
(<a href="#ifig_76">Fig. 76</a>). Hence we see that the tail consists of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
stream of vaporous particles, dashing away from the
sun as if the heat which had called them into being was
a torment from which they were endeavoring to escape.</p>

<p>The tail of a comet is, therefore, not a permanent
part of the body. It is more like the smoke from a
great chimney. The smoke is being incessantly renewed
at one end as the column gets dispersed into the air at
the other. As the comet retreats, the sun’s heat loses
its power. In the chills of space there is, therefore, no
tail-making in progress, while the small mass of the
comet renders it unable to gather back again by its
attraction the materials which have been expelled.
Should it happen that the comet moves in an elliptic
orbit, and thus comes back time after time to be invigorated
by a good roasting from the sun, it will, of
course, endeavor to manufacture a tail each time that it
approaches the source of heat. The quantity of material
available for the formation of tails is limited to the
amount with which the comet originally started; no
fresh supply can be added. If, therefore, the comet
expends a portion of this every time it comes round, an
inevitable consequence seems to follow. Suppose a boy
receives a sovereign when he goes back to school, and
that every time he passes the pastry-cook’s shop some of
his money disappears in a manner that I dare say you
can conjecture, I need not tell you that before long the
sovereign will have totally vanished. In a similar way
comets cannot escape the natural consequences of their
extravagance; their store of tail-making substance must,
therefore, gradually diminish. At each successive return
the tails produced must generally decline in size and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
magnificence, until at last the necessary materials have
been all squandered, and we have the pitiful spectacle
of a comet without any tail at all.</p>

<p>The gigantic size of comets must excite our astonishment.
A pebble tossed into a river would not be more
completely engulfed than is our whole earth when it
enters the tail of one of these bodies. But we now
pass by a sudden transition to speak of the very smallest
bodies, of little objects so minute that you could
carry them in your waistcoat pocket. You will perhaps
be surprised that such things can play an important
part in our system and have a momentous connection
with mighty comets.</p>

<h3>METEORS.</h3>

<p>If you look out from your window at the midnight
sky, or take a walk on a fine clear night, you will occasionally
see a streak of light dash over the heavens,
thus forming what is called a falling, or a shooting,
star (<a href="#ifig_77">Fig. 77</a>). It is not really one of the regular stars
that has darted from its place. The objects we are now
talking of are quite different from stars proper. To
begin with, the shooting stars are comparatively close to
us when we see them, and they are very small, whereas
the stars themselves are enormous globes, far bigger
than our earth, or often even bigger than the sun.
Sometimes a great shooting star is seen which makes
a tremendous blaze of light as bright as the moon, or
even brighter still. These objects we call meteors, and
you will be very fortunate if you can ever see a really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
fine one. Astronomers cannot predict these things as
they predict the appearance of the planets. Bright
meteors consequently appear quite unexpectedly, and
it is a matter of chance as to who shall enjoy the privilege
of beholding them. But it is not about the great
meteors that we are now going to speak particularly;
they are often not so interesting as the small ones.</p>

<div id="ifig_77" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img src="images/i_p285.jpg" width="420" height="278" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 77.</span>—A Brilliant Meteor.</div></div>

<p>These little meteoroids, as we shall call them, have
a curious history. They become visible to us only at
the very last moment of their existence—in fact, the
streak of light which forms a shooting star is merely
the destruction of a meteoroid. You must always remember
that we are here living at the bottom of a great
ocean of air, and above the air extends the empty space.
Air is a great impediment to motion; a large part of
the power of a locomotive engine has to be expended
solely in pushing the air out of the way so as to allow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
the train to get through. The faster the speed, the
greater is the tax which the air imposes on the moving
body. A cannon-ball, for instance, loses an immensity
of its speed, and consequently of its power, by having
to bore its way through the air. In outer space beyond
the limits of this atmosphere, a freedom of movement
can be enjoyed of which we know nothing down here.
I spoke of this when discussing the movements of
Encke’s comet. Even this very unsubstantial body
could dash along without appreciable resistance until
it traversed the atmosphere surrounding the sun. But
now we have to speak of the motion of a little object
both small and dense, resembling perhaps a pebble or
a fragment of iron, or some substance of that description.
It is a little body such as this which produces a
shooting star.</p>

<p>For ages and ages the meteoroid has been moving freely
through space. The speed with which it dashes along
greatly exceeds that of any of the motions with which
we are familiar. It is about 100 times as swift as the
pace of a rifle-bullet. About twenty miles would be
covered in a second. You can hardly imagine what
that speed is capable of. Suppose that you put one of
these flying meteoroids beside an express train to race
from London to Edinburgh, the meteoroid would have
won the race before the train had got out of the station.
Or suppose that a shooting star determined to make the
circuit of the earth, it might, so far as pace is concerned,
go entirely around the globe and back to the point from
which it started in a little more than twenty minutes.
But the fact is, you could not make any object down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
here move as fast as a shooting star. No gunpowder
that could be made would be strong enough, in the first
place, and even if the body could once receive the speed,
it would never be able to force its way through the air
uninjured.</p>

<p>So long as a little shooting star is tearing away
through open space we are not able to see it. The
largest telescope in the world would not reveal a
glimpse of anything so small. The meteoroid has no
light of its own, and it is not big enough to exhibit
the light reflected from the sun in the same manner as
a little planet would do. It is only at the moment
when it begins to be destroyed that its visibility commences.
If the little object can succeed in dashing
past our earth without becoming entangled in the atmosphere,
then it will pursue its track with perhaps only
a slight alteration in its path, due to the pull exercised
by the earth. The air which surrounds our globe may
be likened to a vast net, in which if any little meteor
becomes caught its career is over. For when the little
body, after rejoicing in the freedom of open space, dashes
into air, immediately it experiences a terrific resistance;
it has to force the particles of air out of the way so as
to make room for itself, and in doing so it rubs against
them with such vehemence that heat is produced.</p>

<p>I am sure every boy knows that if he rubs a button
upon a board it becomes very hot, in consequence of
the friction. There are many other ways in which we
can illustrate the production of heat in the same manner.
One is a contrivance by which we spin round
rapidly a piece of stick pressed against a board. Quantities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
of heat are thus produced by the friction, and
volumes of smoke rise up. We have read how some
savages are able to produce fire by means of friction
in a somewhat similar manner, but to do so requires a
rare amount of skill and patience. There is another
illustration by which to show how heat can be produced
by friction. A brass tube full of water is so arranged
that it can be turned around very rapidly by the whirling
table. We apply pressure to the tube, and after a minute
or two the water begins to get hot, and then at last to boil,
until ultimately the cork is driven out and a diminutive
and, fortunately, harmless explosion of the friction
boiler takes place. Engineers are aware how frequently
heat is produced by friction, when it is very inconvenient
or dangerous. Indeed, unless the wheels of railway
carriages are kept well greased, the rubbing of the axle
may generate so much heat that conflagrations in the
carriage will ensue. Nature, in the little shooting star,
gives us a striking illustration of the same fact. Perhaps
you may be surprised to hear that the whole brilliancy
of the shooting star is simply due to friction.
As the little body dashes through the air it becomes first
red-hot, then white-hot, until at last it is melted and
turned into vapor. Thus is formed that glowing streak
which we, standing very many miles below, see as a
shooting star.</p>

<p>A bullet when fired from a rifle will fly into pieces
after it has struck against the target, and if you quickly
pick up one of these pieces you will generally find it
quite hot. Whence comes this heat? The bullet, of
course, was cold before the rifleman pulled the trigger.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
No doubt there was a considerable amount of heat
developed by the burning of the gunpowder, but the
bullet was so short a time in contact with the wad,
through which so little heat would pass, that we must
look to some other source for the warmth that has been
acquired. Friction against the barrel as the bullet
passed to the mouth must have warmed the missile a
good deal, and when rubbing against the air the same
influence must have added still further to its temperature,
while the blow against the target would finally
warm it yet more.</p>

<p>In comparing the shooting star with the rifle-bullet
we must remember that the celestial object is travelling
with a pace 100 times as swift as the utmost velocity
that the rifle can produce, and the heat which is generated
by friction is increased in still greater proportion.
If we double the speed, we shall increase the quantity of
heat by friction fourfold; if we increase the speed three
times, then friction will be capable of producing nine
times as much heat. In fact, we must multiply the
number expressing the relative speed by itself—that
is, we must form its square—if we want to find an
accurate measure for the quantity of heat which friction
is able to produce when a rapidly moving body is being
stopped by its aid. The shooting star may have a pace
100 times that of the rifle-bullet, and if we multiply 100
by 100 we get 10,000; consequently we see that the
heat produced by the shooting star before its motion
was arrested in dashing through the air would be
10,000 times that gained by the rifle-bullet in its flight.
If the temperature of the rifle-bullet only rose a single<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
degree by friction, it would thus be possible for the
shooting star to gain 10,000 degrees, and this would
be enough to melt and boil away any object which ever
existed. Thus we need not be surprised that friction
through the air, and friction alone, has proved an adequate
cause for the production of all the heat necessary
to account for the most brilliant of meteors.</p>

<p>It is rather fortunate for us that the meteors do dash
in with this frightful speed; had the little bodies only
moved as quickly as a rifle-bullet, or even only four or
five times as fast, they would have pelted down on the
earth in solid form. Indeed, on rare occasions it does
happen that bodies from the heavens strike down on the
ground. The great majority of those that fall on the
ground, however, become entirely transformed into
harmless vapor. The earth would, indeed, be almost
uninhabitable from this cause alone were it not for the
protection that the air affords us. All day and all
night innumerable missiles would be whizzing about us,
and though many of them are undoubtedly very small,
yet as their speed is 100 times that of a rifle-bullet, the
fusillade would be very unpleasant. It is, indeed, the
intense hurry of these celestial bullets to get at us
which is the very source of our safety. It dissipates
the meteors into streaks of harmless vapor.</p>

<h3>WHAT BECOMES OF THE SHOOTING STARS.</h3>

<p>When we throw a lump of coal on the fire, all that
is soon left is a little pinch of ashes, and the rest of
the coal has vanished. You might think it had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
altogether annihilated, but that is not nature’s way.
Nothing is ever completely destroyed; it is merely
transformed or changed into something else. The
greater part of the coal has united with the oxygen
which it has obtained from the air, and has formed
a new gas, which has ascended the chimney. Every
particle that was in the coal can be thus accounted for,
and in the act of transformation heat is given out.</p>

<p>A meteor also becomes transformed, but the substance
it contains is not lost, though it is changed into
glowing vapors. It is known that with heat enough
any substance can be turned into vapor, just as water
can be boiled into steam. Look at an electric light
flashing between two pieces of carbon. Though carbon
is one of the most difficult substances to melt, yet such
is the intense heat generated by the electric current
that the carbon is not only melted, but is actually
turned into a vapor, and it is this vapor glowing with
heat that gives us the brilliant light. In a similar manner
iron can be rendered red-hot, white-hot, and then
boiled and transformed into an iron vapor, if we may so
call it. There is, indeed, plenty of such iron vapor in
the universe. Quantities of it surround the sun and
some of the stars.</p>

<p>When ordinary steam is chilled it condenses into
little drops of water. So, too, if iron be heated until
it is transformed into vapor, and if that vapor be
allowed to condense, it will ultimately form a dust,
consisting of bits of iron so small that you would
require a microscope to examine them. There is iron
present in the small shooting stars. Other substances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
are also contained therein, and all these materials,
after being boiled by the intense heat, are transformed
into vapor. When the heat subsides, the vapor condenses
again into fine dust, so that the ultimate effect
of the atmosphere on a shooting star is to grind the
little object into excessively fine powder, which is scattered
along the track which the object has pursued.
Sometimes this powder will continue to glow for minutes
after the meteor has vanished, and in the case of
some great meteors this stream of luminous dust in the
air forms a very striking spectacle. A great meteor, or
fire-ball as it is often called, appeared on the 6th of
November, 1869. It flew over Devonshire and Cornwall,
and left a track fifty miles long and four miles
wide. The dust remained visible all along the great
highway for nearly an hour; it formed a glowing cloud
hanging in the sky, and though originally nearly straight,
it became bent and twisted by the winds before it finally
disappeared from view.</p>

<p>We have now to see what becomes of this meteoric
dust which is being incessantly poured into the air from
external space. None of it ever gets away again; for
whenever an unfortunate meteor just touches the air it
is inevitably captured and pulverized. That dust subsides
slowly, but we do not find it easy to distinguish
the particles which have come from the shooting stars,
because there is so much floating dust which has come
from other sources.</p>

<p>A sunbeam is the prettiest way of revealing the
existence of the motes with which the air is charged.
The sunbeam renders these motes visible exactly in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
same way as planets become visible when sunbeams
fall on them in far-distant space. But if we have not
the sunbeams here, we can throw across the room a
beam of electric light, and it is seen glowing all along
its track, simply because the air of the room, like air
everywhere, is charged with myriads of small floating
particles. If you hold the flame of a spirit-lamp
beneath this beam, you will see what seems like columns
of black smoke ascending through it. But these
columns are not smoke, they are pure air, or rather air
in which the solid particles have been transformed into
vapor by the heat from the spirit-flame.</p>

<p>The motes abound everywhere in the air. We take
thousands of them into our lungs every time we breathe.
They are on the whole gradually sinking and subsiding
downwards, but they yield to every slightest current,
so that when looking at a sunbeam you will find them
moving in all directions. It is sometimes hard to
believe that the little objects are tending downwards,
but if you look on the top of a book that has lain for a
time on a book-shelf, you find there a quantity of dust,
produced by the motes which have gradually subsided
where they found a quiet spot and were allowed sufficient
time to do so.</p>

<p>The great majority of these particles consist, no
doubt, of fragments of terrestrial objects. The dust
from the roads, the smoke from the factories, and numerous
other sources, are incessantly adding their objectionable
particles to the air. There can be no doubt
that the shooting stars also contribute their mites to the
dust with which the atmosphere is ever charged. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
motes in the murky air of our towns have no doubt
chiefly originated from sources on this earth. Many of
these sources it would be impossible to regard as of a
romantic description. We may, however, feel confident
that among those teeming myriads of small floating
objects are many little particles which, having had their
origin from shooting stars, are now gradually sinking
to the earth.</p>

<p>This is not a mere surmise, for dust has been collected
from lofty Alpine snows, from the depths of the
sea, and from other localities far removed from the
haunts of men. From such collections, tiny particles
of iron have been obtained, which have evidently been
once in a molten condition. There is no conceivable
explanation for the origin of iron fragments in such
situations, except that they have been dropped from
shooting stars.</p>

<p>I am sure you have often helped in the making of a
gigantic snowball. You begin with a small quantity
of snow that can be worked with your hands. Then
you have rolled it along the ground until it has become
so big and so heavy that you must get a few playmates
to help you, until at last it has grown so unwieldy that
you can move it no longer, and then you apply your
artistic powers to carving out a statue. The snowball
has grown by the addition of material to it from without,
and as it became heavier and heavier, it lapped up
more and more of the snow as it rolled along; so that
with each increase of size, its capacity for becoming
still larger has also increased. I want to liken our
earth to a snowball which goes rolling on through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
space, and every day, every hour, every minute, is
gathering up and taking into it the little shooting stars
that it meets with on its way. No doubt the annual
accumulation is a very small quantity when compared
with the whole size of the earth; but the earth is
always drawing in, and now, at all events, never giving
back again; so that when this process is carried on long
enough, astonishing results may be obtained.</p>

<p>You have all heard many maxims on this subject—how
every little saving will at length reach a respectable
or a gigantic total. Nature abounds with illustrations
of the principle. All the water that thunders
over Niagara is merely a sufficient number of little
drops of rain collected together. Our earth has been
gradually hoarding up, during countless ages, all the
meteor dust that has rained upon it; and the larger the
earth grows, the bigger is the net which it spreads, and
the greater is the power it has to capture the wandering
bodies. Thus, our earth, ages and ages ago, may have
been considerably smaller than it is at present; in fact,
a large proportion of this globe on which we dwell may
have been derived from the little shooting stars which
incessantly rain in upon its surface.</p>

<h3>GRAND METEORS.</h3>

<p>I dare say that many of those present will, in the
course of their lives, have opportunities of seeing some
of the great meteors, or fire-balls, which are occasionally
displayed. Generally speaking, about one hundred or
so of these splendid objects are recorded every year.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
We are never apprised that they are coming; they take
us unawares, and therefore we have no opportunity to
make proper arrangements for seeing them. There is
only the chance that such persons as have been fortunate
enough to see them will have noted the circumstances
with sufficient accuracy to enable us to make
use of their observations.</p>

<div id="ifig_78" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_p296.jpg" width="398" height="283" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 78.</span>—How to find the Height of a Meteor.</div></div>

<p>The chief point to determine is the height of the
meteor above the earth. For this we must have two
observations at least, made in places as far asunder
as possible. Suppose an observer at London and an
observer at York were both witnesses of a splendid
meteor; if they find, on subsequent comparison, that
their observations were made at the same moment, there
is no reasonable doubt that it was the same object they
both saw. The observer at York describes the meteor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
as lying to the south, halfway down from the point
directly over his head towards the horizon. The London
observer speaks of the meteor as being to the
north; and to him also it appeared that the object was
halfway down towards his horizon from the point
directly over his head. If you know a little Euclid,
you can easily show from these facts that the height of
the meteor must have been half the distance between
London and York, that is, 85 miles (<a href="#ifig_78">Fig. 78</a>).</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that the mode of discovering
the meteor’s height will be always quite such a simple
process as it has been in the case of the London and
York observations. The principle is, however, the same—that
whenever from two sufficiently distant positions
the direction of the meteor has been observed, its path
is known—just as on <a href="#Page_21">p. 21</a> we showed how the
height of the suspended ball was obtained from observations
at each end of the table. Generally speaking,
bright meteors begin at an elevation of between
fifty and one hundred miles, and they become extinguished
before they are within twenty miles of the
ground.</p>

<p>Sometimes a tremendous explosion will take place
during the passage of a meteor through the air. There
was a celebrated instance in America on the 21st of
December, 1876, which will give an idea of one of these
objects possessing exceptional magnificence. It began
in Kansas about seventy-five miles high, and thence it
flew for a thousand miles at a speed of ten or fifteen miles
a second, until it disappeared somewhere near Lake
Ontario. Over a certain region between Chicago and St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
Louis, the great ball of fire burst into a number of pieces,
and formed a cluster of glowing stars that seemed to
chase each other over the sky. This cluster must have
been about forty miles long and five miles wide, and
when the explosion occurred a most terrific noise was produced,
so loud that many thought it was an earthquake.
A remarkable circumstance illustrates the tremendous
height at which this explosion occurred. The meteor
had burst into pieces, the display was all over, and was
beginning to be forgotten, and yet nothing had been
<em>heard</em>. It was not until a quarter of an hour after the
explosion had been <em>seen</em> that a fearful crash was heard
at Bloomington. The explosion actually occurred 180
miles from the spot, and as sound takes five seconds to
travel a mile, you can easily calculate that the noise
required a quarter of an hour for its journey. What a
tremendous noise it must have been!</p>

<p>Shooting stars are of every grade of brightness.
Beginning with the more gorgeous objects which have
been compared with the moon or even with the sun
himself, we descend to others as bright as Venus or as
Jupiter; others are as bright as stars of various degrees
of brilliancy. Fainter shooting stars are much more
numerous than the conspicuous ones; in fact, there are
multitudes of these objects so extremely feeble that the
unaided eye would not show them. They only become
perceptible in a telescope. It is not uncommon while
watching the heavens at night to notice a faint streak
of light dashing across the field of the instrument.
This is a shooting star which is invisible except through
the telescope.</p>

<h3>THE GREAT NOVEMBER SHOWERS.</h3>

<div id="ifig_79" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 29em;">
  <img src="images/i_p299.jpg" width="451" height="474" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 79.</span>—A Great Shower of Shooting Stars.</div></div>

<p>Occasionally we have the superb spectacle of a shower
of shooting stars. None of you, my young friends, can
as yet have had the good fortune to witness one of the
specially grand displays, but you may live in hope;
there are still showers to come. Astronomers have
ventured on the prophecy that in or about the year
1899 you will have the opportunity of seeing a magnificent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
exhibition of this kind. There is only one
ground for anxiety, and that is as to whether the clouds
will keep out of the way for the occasion. I think I
cannot explain my subject better than by taking you
into my confidence and showing you the reasons on
which we base this prediction. The last great shooting-star
shower took place in the year 1866, or, perhaps, I
should rather say that this was the last display from
the same shooting-star system as that about which we
are now going to speak. On the night of the 13th of
November, 1866, astronomers were everywhere delighted
by a superb spectacle. Enjoyment of the wondrous
sight was not only for astronomers. Every one who
loves to see the great sights of nature will have good
reason for remembering that night. I certainly shall
never forget it. It was about ten o’clock when a brilliant
meteor or two first flashed across the sky, then
presently they came in twos and threes, and later on
in dozens, in scores, in hundreds. These meteors were
brilliant objects, any one of which would have extorted
admiration on an ordinary night. What, then, was the
splendor of the display when they came on in multitudes?
For two or three hours the great shower lasted,
and then gradually subsided.</p>

<p>We were not taken unawares on this occasion, for the
shower was expected, and had been, in fact, awaited
with eager anticipation. It should first be noticed that
each year some shooting stars may always be looked for
on or about the 13th of November. Every thirty-three
years, or thereabouts, the ordinary spectacle breaks out
into a magnificent display. It has also been found that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
for nearly 1000 years there have been occasional grand
showers of meteors at the time of year mentioned,
and all these incidents agree with the supposition that
they are merely repetitions of the regular thirty-three-year
shower. The first was in the year <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 902, which
an old chronicle speaks of as the “year of the stars,”
from the extraordinary display which then took place.
I do not think the good people 1000 years ago fully
appreciated the astronomical interest of such spectacles;
in fact, they were often frightened out of their wits,
and thought the end of the world had come. Doubtless
many ancient showers have taken place of which
we have no record whatever. In more modern days we
have had somewhat fuller information; for example, on
the night between the 12th and 13th of November, 1833,
a shower was magnificently seen in America. Mr.
Kirkwood tells us that a gentleman of South Carolina
described the effect on the negroes of his plantation as
follows: “I was suddenly awakened by the most distressing
cries that ever fell on my ears. Shrieks of
horror and cries for mercy I could hear from most of
the negroes of the three plantations, amounting in all
to about 600 or 800. While earnestly listening for the
cause, I heard a faint voice near the door calling my
name. I arose, and taking my sword, stood at the door.
At this moment I heard the same voice still beseeching
me to arise, and crying out that the world was on fire.
I then opened the door, and it is difficult to say which
excited me the most—the awfulness of the scene or
the distressed cries of the negroes. Upwards of a
hundred lay prostrate on the ground, some speechless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
and some with the bitterest cries, but with their hands
raised praying for mercy. The scene was truly awful,
for never did rain fall much thicker than the meteors
fell towards the earth.”</p>

<p>By the study of many records of great showers it
was learned that the interval at which these grand
displays succeeded one another was about thirty-three
years; and when it was remembered that the last great
shower was in 1833 it was confidently expected that
another similar display would take place in 1866. This
was fully confirmed. Yet another thirty-three years
brings us to 1899, when we have good reason for looking
forward to a grand shower of these bodies. It may be
expected to occur on November 14 or November 15. It
may, however, possibly be that a shower will occur on
the same days of the succeeding year.</p>

<div id="ifig_80" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22em;">
  <img src="images/i_p303.jpg" width="339" height="302" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 80.</span>—The Earth crossing the Track of Meteors.</div></div>

<p>We know a good deal now as regards the movements
of these little objects. I want you to think of a vast
swarm, something like a flock of birds, which I dare
say you have often seen flying high in the air; the
difference, however, is that the flock of meteors is
enormously greater than any flock of birds ever was;
and the meteors, too, are scattered so widely apart, that
each one may be miles away from its next neighbors.
Usually the meteoric shoal is many millions of miles
long, and perhaps a hundred thousand miles in width.
The great flock of meteors travels through space in a
certain definite track. We have learned how the sun
guides a planet, and forces the planet to move around
him in an ellipse. But our sun will also condescend
to guide an object no bigger than a shooting star. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
bullet, a pea, or even a grain of sand will be held to an
elliptic course around the sun as carefully as the great
Jupiter himself. The entire shoal of meteors may
therefore pursue their common journey around the sun
as if inspired by a common purpose, each individual
member of the host being, however, guided by the sun,
and performing its path in real independence of its
neighbors. The orbit followed by this shoal of meteors
is enormously large and wide. Here is a sketch of the
path (<a href="#ifig_80">Fig. 80</a>), and I have laid down the position of
the orbit of the earth, but not on the same scale. The
ellipse is elongated, so that while the shoal approaches
comparatively close to the sun at one end of its journey,
at the other end it goes out to an enormous distance,
far beyond the orbit of the earth—beyond, indeed, the
orbit of Jupiter or Saturn; in fact, it reaches to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
path of Uranus. To accomplish so vast a journey as
this thirty-three years and a quarter are required, and
now you will be easily able to see why we get periodical
visits from the shoal.</p>

<p>It is, however, a mere piece of good fortune that we
ever encounter the November meteors. Probably there
are numerous other shoals of meteors quite as important
which we never see, just in the same way as there
are many shoals of fish in the sea that never come into
our net. The earth moves round the sun in a path
which is very nearly a circle, and the shoal moves
round in this long oval. We cannot easily represent
the true state of things by mere diagrams which show
all these objects on the same plane. This does not
give an accurate representation of the orbits. I think
you will better understand what I mean by means of
some wire rings. Make a round one to represent the
path of the earth, and a long oval one to represent the
path of the meteors. There is to be a small opening in
the circular ring so that we can slip one of the orbits
inside the other. If we are to see the meteors, it is of
course necessary that they should strike the earth’s
atmosphere, for they are not visible to us when they
lie at a distance like the moon or like the planets. It
is necessary that there be a collision between the earth
and the shoal of meteors. But there never could be a
collision between two trains unless the lines on which
these trains run meet each other; therefore, it is necessary
that this long ellipse shall actually cross the
earth’s track; it will not do to have it pass inside like
the two links of a chain; our earth would then miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
the meteors altogether, and we should never see them.
There are very likely many of such shoals of meteors
revolving in this way, and thus escaping our notice
entirely.</p>

<p>You will also understand why there is no use in
looking for these showers except on a particular day of
November. On that day, and on that day alone, the
earth appears at that particular point of its route where
the latter crosses the track of the shoal. On the 1st of
November, for instance, the earth has not yet reached
the point where it could meet with these bodies. By
the end of November it has passed too far. But even
supposing that the earth is crossing the track of the
meteors on the 13th of November, it is still possible
that only a few, or none at all, shall be seen. The
shoal may not happen to be at that spot at the right
time. For a display of meteors to occur, it is therefore
necessary that the shoal shall happen to be passing this
particular stage of the journey on the 13th of November.
In 1866 the earth dipped through the shoal and
caught a great many of these meteors in its net. For
a few hours the earth was engaged in the capture,
until it emerged on the other side of the shoal, and the
display was at an end.</p>

<p>Sometimes it happens that in two years following
each other, grand showers of meteors are seen. The
reason of this is that the shoal is very long and thin,
and consequently if the earth passes through the beginning
of the shoal one year, it may have returned to the
same point next year before the whole length of the
shoal has completely passed. In this case we shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
have two great showers in consecutive years. Thus a
very fine display was seen in America on the proper
day in 1867, while many stragglers were also observed
during the three subsequent recurrences of the same
date.</p>

<p>Whenever the 13th of November comes round we
generally meet with at least five shooting stars belonging
to this same system, and we must explain how this
occurs. Suppose there is a small racecourse so that the
competitors will have to run a great many times round
before the race is over. Let there be a very large number
of entries, and let the majority of the athletes be
fairly good runners, while a few are exceptionally good
with varying degrees of excellence, and a few are very
bad, some being worse than others. The whole group
starts together in a cluster at the signal, and perhaps
for the first round or two they may keep tolerably well
together. It will be noticed the cluster begins to elongate
as one circuit after another is made; the better
runners draw out to the front, and the slower runners
lag further and further behind; at last it may happen
that those at the head will have gained a whole round
on those at the tail, while the other runners of varying
degrees of speed will be scattered all round the course.
The majority of the runners, if of nearly equal speed,
may continue in a pretty dense group.</p>

<p>Precisely similar has been the great celestial race
which these meteors are running. They started on
their grand career centuries ago, and ever since then
they have been flying round and round their mighty
course. The greater proportion of the meteors still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
stay close together, and their pace is nearly uniform.
The exceptionally smart ones have shot ahead, the exceptionally
slow ones have lagged behind, and thus it
happens that, after fifty or more revolutions have been
completed, the shape of the original swarm has become
considerably modified. Its length has been drawn out,
while the stragglers and the fastest runners have been
scattered all around the path. Across this course our
earth carries us every November; there we usually
encounter some of the members of this swarm which
have strayed from the great host; they flash into the
air, and thus it is that some of these bodies are generally
seen every November.</p>

<div id="ifig_81" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23em;">
  <img src="images/i_p308.jpg" width="365" height="364" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 81.</span>—The Radiant.</div></div>

<p>During a shooting-star shower it is interesting to
notice that all the meteors seem to diverge from a
single point. In the adjoining figure (<a href="#ifig_81">Fig. 81</a>), which
shows the directions of a number of meteors’ tracks,
you will notice that every one seems to radiate from a
certain point of the sky. In the case of the shower of
the 13th–15th of November this point lies in the constellation
Leo. I must refer you to the Appendix for
a description of the way to find Leo or the Lion. The
radiant point, as we term it, of this system of meteors
is there situated. It is true that the meteors themselves
do not generally seem to come all the way from this
place. It is the direction of their luminous trails produced
backward that carries the eye to the radiant
(<a href="#ifig_81">Fig. 81</a>). If a meteor were actually seen there, it would
be certainly coming straight towards us; it would not
then appear as a streak of light at all; it would merely
seem like a star which suddenly blazed into splendor and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
then again sank down into invisibility. Every meteor
which appeared near this point would be directed very
nearly at the observer, and its path would therefore
seem very much foreshortened. I can illustrate this
with a long straight rod. If I point it directly at you,
you can only see the end. If I point it nearly at you,
it will seem very much shortened. During the great
shower in 1866 many of the meteors could be observed
so close to the radiant in Leo that they seemed merely
like very short marks in the sky; some of them, indeed,
seemed to be merely starlike points swelling up into
brilliance and then going out. Hence it is that we call
this system of shooting stars the “Leonids.” They bear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
this name because their radiant lies in the constellation
Leo, and unless the direction of a shooting star emanates
from this point it does not belong to the Leonids.
Even if it did so, the meteor would not be a Leonid
unless the date was right, namely, on the 13th of
November, or within a day thereof. We thus have
two characteristics which belong to a system of shooting
stars; there is the date on which they occur and
the point from which they radiate.</p>

<h3>OTHER GREAT SHOWERS.</h3>

<p>To illustrate what I have said, we will speak about
another system of shooting stars; they are due every
August, from the 9th to the 11th, and their directions
diverge from a point in the constellation of Perseus.
I may remind you of the dates of the recurrence of
this shower as well as of the November meteors of
which we have just spoken, by quoting the following
<span class="locked">production:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If you November’s stars would see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the fourteenth watching be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In August, too, stars shine through heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On nights between nine and eleven.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">It may be worth your while to remember these lines,
and always to keep a look-out on the days named.
The August meteors, the Perseids we often call them,
do not make gorgeous displays, in particular years,
with the regularity of the Leonids. There have been,
no doubt, some exceptionally grand showers between
the 9th and the 11th of August, but we cannot predict<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
when the next splendid one is due. There are vast
numbers of stragglers all round the track of the Perseids.
In fact, it would seem as if the great race had
gone on for such a long period that the cluster had to
a great extent broken up, and that a large proportion of
the meteors were now scattered the whole way around
the course with tolerable uniformity. This being so, it
follows that every time we cross the track we are nearly
certain to fall in with a few of the stragglers, though we
may never enjoy the tremendous spectacle of a plunge
through a dense host of meteoroids.</p>

<p>There are many other showers besides the two I have
mentioned. Some shooting stars are to be seen almost
every fine night, and those astronomers who pay particular
attention to this subject are able to make out
scores of small showers which might not interest you.
Each of these is fully defined by the night of the year
on which it occurs and the position of the point in the
heavens from which the meteors radiate. Of these I
must mention one. It is not usually very attractive,
but it has a particular interest, as I shall now explain.</p>

<p>On the 27th of November, 1872, a beautiful meteoric
shower took place. You will notice that though the
month is the same, the day is entirely different from
that on which the Leonids appear. This shower of the
27th is called the Andromedes, because the lines of
direction of the shooting stars of which it is composed
seem to diverge from a point in the constellation
Andromeda. Ordinarily speaking, there is no special
display of meteors connected with the annual return of
this day; but in 1872 astronomers were astonished by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
an exhibition of shooting stars belonging to this system.
They were not at all bright when compared with
the Leonid meteors. They were, however, sufficiently
numerous to arrest the attention of very many, even
among those who do not usually pay much attention to
the heavens.</p>

<p>The chief interest of the shower of Andromedes
centers in a remarkable discovery connecting meteors
and comets. There is a comet which was discovered
by the astronomer Biela. It is a small object, requiring
a telescope to show it. This comet completes each
revolution in a period of about seven years; or rather,
I should say, that was the time which the comet used
to spend on its journey, for a life of trouble and disaster
seems of late to have nearly extinguished the unfortunate
object. In 1872 the comet was due in our neighborhood,
and on the night of the 27th of November, in
the same year, the earth crossed the track, and, in doing
so, the shower of shooting stars was seen. This was a
remarkable coincidence. We crossed the path of the
comet at the time when we knew the comet ought to
be there; and though we did not then see the comet,
we saw a shower of shooting stars, and a wonderful
shower too. A circumstance so peculiar suggested at
once that the comet and the shooting stars must in
some way or other be connected together. This is a
suggestion we can test in another manner. We know
the history of the comet, and we are aware that at the
very time of the shower, the comet was approaching
from the direction of the constellation of Andromeda.
It was coming, in fact, from the very quarter whence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
the shooting stars have themselves travelled. Taking
all these things together, it seems impossible to doubt
that the shoal of shooting stars was, if not actually
the comet itself, something closely connected with that
famous body.</p>

<h3>METEORITES.</h3>

<p>Some years ago, a farmer living near Rowton, in
Shropshire, noticed on a path in a field a hole which
had been suddenly made by some mysterious and unknown
agent. The laborers who were near told him
they had just heard a remarkable noise; and when
the farmer put his hand down into the hole, he felt
something hot at the bottom of it. He took a spade
and dug up the strange body, and found it to be a piece
of iron, weighing about seven pounds. He was naturally
amazed at such an occurrence, and brought the
body home with him.</p>

<p>Where did that piece of iron come from? It is plain
that it could not have been always in the ground. The
noise and the recently made hole showed that was not
the case, and that is confirmed by the fact that the iron
was hot. A piece of iron within a few feet of the earth’s
surface cannot have remained warm for any length of
time. It is therefore clear that the iron must have tumbled
from the sky. This is a marvellous notion; in
fact, it seems so incredible that at first people refused
to believe that such things as stones or solid lumps of
iron could have fallen from the heavens to the earth.
But they had to believe it; the evidence was too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
conclusive. Fortunately, however, the occurrence is
a comparatively rare one; indeed, our life on this
globe would have an intolerable anxiety added to it
if showers of iron hailstones like that at Rowton were
at all of frequent occurrence. We should want umbrellas
of a more substantial description than those
which suffice for the rains we actually experience.
There are, indeed, instances on record of persons having
been killed by the fearful blows given by these
bodies in falling.</p>

<p>The Rowton siderite is a comparatively small one;
pieces weighing hundredweights, and even tons, have
been collected together in our museums. I would recommend
you to pay a visit to that interesting room
in our great British Museum in which these meteorites
are exhibited. There we see actual specimens of celestial
bodies which we can feel or weigh, and which our
chemists can analyze. It may be noticed that they only
contain substances that we already know on this earth.
This celestial iron has often been made use of in primitive
times before man understood how to smelt iron
from its ore and how to transform it from cast iron to
wrought iron. Nature seems to have taken heed of
their wants, and occasionally to have thrown down a
lump or two for the benefit of those who were so fortunate
as to secure them.</p>

<p>That these stones or irons drop from the sky is absolutely
certain, but when we try to find out their earlier
history we become involved in not a few difficulties.
Nobody really knows the true history of these objects,
but the view of their origin which seems to me to possess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
fewer difficulties than any other view is that which we
may call the Columbiad Theory. I use this expression
because every boy or girl listening to me ought to have
read Jules Verne’s wonderful book, “From the Earth
to the Moon,” and if any of you have not read it, the
sooner you do so the better. It is there narrated how
the gun club of Baltimore designed a magnificent cannon
which was sunk deep into the ground, and then
received a terrific charge of guncotton, on which a great
hollow projectile was carefully lowered, containing
inside the three adventurous explorers who desired to
visit the moon. Calculations were produced with a
view of showing that by firing on a particular day
the explosion would drive the projectile up to the
moon. There was, however, the necessary condition
that the speed of projection should be great enough.
The gun club were accurate in saying that if the cannon
were able to discharge the projectile with a speed
twenty or thirty times as great as that which had ever
been obtained with any other cannon, then the missile
would ascend up and up forever if no further influence
were exerted on it. No doubt we have to overlook the
resistance on the air and a few other little difficulties,
but to this extent, at all events, the gun club were
right: that a velocity of about six or seven miles a
second would suffice to carry a body away from the
gravitation of the earth.</p>

<p>No one supposes that there were ever Columbiad
cannons on our globe by which projectiles were shot
up into space; but it seems possible that there may
have been in very ancient days volcanoes on the earth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
with a shooting power as great as that which President
Barbicane designed for the big cannon.</p>

<p>Even now we have some active volcanoes of great
energy on our earth, and we know that in former days
the volcanoes must have been still more powerful; that,
in fact, the Vesuvius of the present must be merely
a popgun in comparison with volcanoes which have
shaken the earth in those primitive days when it had
just cooled down from its original fiery condition. Some
of these early volcanoes, in the throes of their mighty
eruptions, appear to have shot forth pieces of iron and
volcanic substances with a violence great enough to
carry them off into space.</p>

<p>Suppose that a missile were projected upwards, it
would ascend higher and higher, and gravity would,
of course, tend to drag it back again down to earth.
It can be shown that with an initial speed of six or
seven miles a second the missiles would never return
to the earth if only influenced by its attraction. The
subsequent history of such a projectile would be guided
by the laws according to which a planet moves. The
body is understood to escape the destination which was
aimed at by the Columbiad. I mean, of course, that it
is not supposed to hit the moon. Of course, this might
conceivably happen; but most of the projectiles would
go quite wide of the mark, and would travel off into
space.</p>

<p>Though the earth would be unable to recall the projectile,
the attraction of the sun would still guide it,
whether it was as big as a paving-stone or ever so much
larger or smaller. The body would be constrained to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
follow a path like a little planet around the sun. This
track it would steadily pursue for ages. The wanderer
would, however, cross the earth’s track once during
each of its revolutions at the point from which it was
projected. Of course, it will generally happen that the
earth will not be there at the time the meteorite is crossing,
and the meteorite will not be there at the time the
earth is crossing. Nothing will therefore happen, and
the object goes again on its long rounds. But sometimes
it must occur that a meteor does not get past the junction
without coming so close to the earth that it plunges
into the air, often producing a noise and generating a
streak of light like a shooting star. Then it tumbles
down, and is restored to that earth whence it originally
came.</p>

<p>If this be the true view—and I think there are less
weighty objections to it than to any other I know of—then
the history of the piece of iron that was found in
Shropshire would be somewhat as follows. Many millions
of years ago, when the fires of our earth were
much more vigorous than they are in these dull times,
a terrific volcanic outbreak took place, and vast quantities
of material were shot into space, of which this is
one of the fragments. During all the ages that have
since elapsed this piece of iron has followed its lonely
track. In a thousandth part of the time rust and decay
would have destroyed it had it lain on the earth, but in
the solitudes of space there was found no air or damp
to produce corrosion. At last, after the completion of
its long travels, it again crashed down on the earth.</p>

<p>We have now briefly surveyed the extent of the solar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
system. We began with the sun, which presides over
all, and then we discussed the various planets with their
satellites, next we considered the eccentric comets, and
finally the minute bodies which, as shooting stars or
meteorites, must be regarded as forming part of the
Sun’s system. In our closing lecture we shall have to
deal with objects of a far more magnificent character.</p>

<h3>WE TRY TO MAKE A MAP.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> group of bodies which cluster around our sun
forms a little island, so to speak, in the extent of infinite
space. We may illustrate this by a map in which we
shall endeavor to show the stars placed at their proper
relative distances. We first open the compasses one
inch, and thus draw a little circle to represent the path
of the earth. We are not going to put in all the planets.
We take Neptune, the outermost, at once. To draw its
path I open the compasses to thirty inches, and draw a
circle with that radius. That will do for our solar system,
though the comets no doubt will roam beyond
these limits. To complete our map we ought of course
to put in some stars. There are a hundred million to
choose from, and we shall begin with the brightest. It
is often called the Dog Star, but astronomers know it
better as Sirius. Let us see where it is to be placed
on our map. Sirius is beyond Neptune, so it must be
outside somewhere. Indeed, it is a good deal further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
off than Neptune; so I try at the edge of the drawing-board;
I have got a method of making a little calculation
that I do not intend to trouble you with, but I
can assure you that the results it leads me to are
quite correct; they show me that this board is not
big enough. But could a board which was big enough
fit into this lecture theatre? Here, again, I make my
little calculations, and I find that there would not be
room for a board sufficiently great; in fact, if I put the
sun here at one end, with its planets around it, Sirius
would be too near on the same scale if it were at
the further corner. The board would have to go out
through the wall of the theatre, out through London.
Indeed, big as London is, it would not be large enough
to contain the drawing-board that I should require. It
would have to stretch about twenty miles from where
we are now assembled. We may therefore dismiss any
hope of making a practical map of our system on this
scale if Sirius is to have its proper place. Let us, then,
take some other star. We shall naturally try with the
nearest of all. It is one that we do not know in this
part of the world, but those that live in the southern
hemisphere are well acquainted with it. The name of
this star is Alpha Centauri. Even for this star, we
should require a drawing three or four miles long if
the distance from the earth to the sun is to be taken as
one inch. You see what an isolated position our sun
and his planets occupy. The members of the family
are all close together, and the nearest neighbors are
situated at enormous distances. There is a good reason
for this separation. The stars are very pretty and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
perfectly harmless to us where they are at present
situated. They might be very troublesome neighbors
if they were very much closer to our system. It is
therefore well they are so far off; they would be constantly
making disturbance in the sun’s family if they
were near at hand. Sometimes they would be dragging
us into unpleasantly great heat by bringing us too close
to the sun, or producing a coolness by pulling us away
from the sun, which would be quite as disagreeable.</p>

<h3>THE STARS ARE SUNS.</h3>

<p>We are about to discuss one of the grandest truths
in the whole of nature. We have had occasion to see
that this sun of ours is a magnificent globe immensely
larger than the greatest of his planets, while the greatest
of these planets is immensely larger than this earth;
but now we are to learn that our sun is, indeed, only a
star not nearly so bright as many of those which shine
over our heads every night. We are comparatively
close to the sun, so that we are able to enjoy his
beautiful light and cheering heat. Each of those other
myriads of stars is a sun, and the splendor of those
distant suns is often far greater than that of our own.
We are, however, so enormously far from them that
they appear dwindled down to insignificance. To judge
impartially between our sun or star and such a sun or
star as Sirius we should stand halfway between the
two; it is impossible to make a fair estimate when we
find ourselves situated close to one star and a million
times as far from the other. After allowance is made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
for the imperfections of our point of view, we are
enabled to realize the majestic truth that the sun is
no more than a star, and that the other stars are no
less than suns. This gives us an imposing idea of the
extent and the magnificence of the universe in which
we are situated. Look up at the sky at night—you
will see a host of stars; try to think that every one of
them is itself a sun. It may probably be that those
suns have planets circulating round them, but it is
hopeless for us to expect to see such planets. Were
you standing on one of those stars and looking towards
our system, you would not perceive the sun to be the
brilliant and gorgeous object that we knew so well. If
you could see him at all, he would merely seem like a
star, not nearly so bright as many of those you can see
at night. Even if you had the biggest of telescopes to
aid your vision, you could never discern from one of
these bodies the planets which surround the sun. No
astronomer in the stars could see Jupiter even if his
sight were a thousand times as good or his telescopes a
thousand times as powerful as any sight or telescope
that we know. So minute an object as our earth would,
of course, be still more hopelessly beyond the possibility
of vision.</p>

<h3>THE NUMBERS OF THE STARS.</h3>

<p>To count the stars involves a task which lies beyond
the power of man to accomplish. Even without the
aid of any telescope, we can see a great multitude of
stars from this part of the world. There are also many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
constellations in the southern hemisphere which never
appear above our horizon. If, however, we were to go
to the equator, then, by waiting there for a twelve-month,
all the stars in the heavens would have been
successively exposed to view. An astronomer, Houzeau,
with the patience to count them, enumerated about
6000. This is the naked-eye estimate of the star-population
of the heavens; but if, instead of relying
on unaided vision, you get the assistance of a little
telescope, you will be astounded at the enormous multitude
of stars which are disclosed.</p>

<div id="ifig_82" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img src="images/i_p322.jpg" width="447" height="335" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 82.</span>—The Great Bear and the Pole.</div></div>

<p>An ordinary opera-glass or binocular is a very useful
instrument for looking at the stars in the heavens. If
you employ an instrument of this sort, you will be
amazed to find that the heavens teem with additional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
hosts of stars that your unaided vision would never have
given you knowledge of. Any part of the sky may
be observed; but, just to give an illustration, I shall
take one special region, namely, that of the Great Bear
(<a href="#ifig_82">Fig. 82</a>). The seven well-known stars are here shown,
four of which form a sort of oblong, while the other
three represent the tail. I would like you to make this
little experiment. On a fine clear night, count how
many stars there are within this oblong; they are all
very faint, but you will be able to see a few, and, with
good sight, and on a clear night, you may see perhaps
ten. Next take your opera-glass and sweep it over
the same region; if you will carefully count the stars
it shows, you will find fully 200; so that the opera-glass
has, in this part of the sky, revealed nearly twenty
times as many stars as could be seen without its aid.
As 6000 stars can be seen by the eye all over the
heavens, we may fairly expect that twenty times that
number—that is to say, 120,000 stars—could be
shown by the opera-glass over the entire sky. Let us
go a step further, and employ a telescope, the object-glass
of which is three inches across. This is a useful
telescope to have, and, if a good one, will show multitudes
of pleasing objects, though an astronomer would
not consider it very powerful. An instrument like
this, small enough to be carried in the hand, has been
applied to the task of enumerating the stars in the
northern half of the sky, and 320,000 stars were
counted. Indeed, the actual number that might have
been seen with it is considerably greater, for when the
astronomer Argelander made this memorable investigation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
he was unable to reckon many of the stars in
localities where they lay very close together. This
grand count only extended to half the sky, and, assuming
that the other half is as richly inlaid with stars, we
see that a little telescope like that we have supposed
will, when swept over the heavens, reveal a number of
stars which exceeds that of the population of any city
in England except London. It exhibits more than one
hundred times as many stars as our eyes could possibly
reveal. Still, we are only at the beginning of the
count; the very great telescopes add largely to the
number. There are multitudes of stars which in small
instruments we cannot see, but which are distinctly
visible from our great observatories. That telescope
would be still but a comparatively small one which
would show as many stars in the sky as there are
people living in this mighty city of London; and with
the greatest instruments, the tale of stars has risen to
a number far greater than that of the entire population
of Great Britain.</p>

<p>In addition to those stars which the largest telescopes
show us, there are myriads which make their presence
evident in a wholly different way. It is only in quite
recent times that an attempt has been made to develop
fully the powers of photography in representing the
celestial objects. On a photographic plate which has
been exposed to the sky in a great telescope the stars
are recorded by thousands. Many of these may, of
course, be observed with a good telescope, but there
are not a few others which no one ever saw in a telescope,
which apparently no one ever could see, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
the photograph is able to show them. We do not, however,
employ a camera like that which the photographer
uses who is going to take your portrait. The astronomer’s
plate is put into his telescope, and then the telescope
is turned towards the sky. On that plate the
stars produce their images, each by its own light. Some
of these images are excessively faint, but we give a very
long exposure of an hour or two hours; sometimes as
much as four hours’ exposure is given to a plate so sensitive
that a mere fraction of a second would sufficiently
expose it during the ordinary practice of taking a photograph
in daylight. We thus afford sufficient time
to enable the fainter objects to indicate their presence
upon the sensitive film. Even with an exposure of a
single hour a picture exhibiting 16,000 stars has been
taken by Mr. Isaac Roberts, of Liverpool. Yet the
portion of the sky which it represents is only one ten-thousandth
part of the entire heavens. It should be added
that the region which Mr. Roberts has photographed is
furnished with stars in rather exceptional profusion.</p>

<p>Here, at last, we have obtained some conception of
the sublime scale on which the stellar universe is constructed.
Yet even these plates cannot represent all
the stars that the heavens contain. We have every
reason for knowing that with larger telescopes, with
more sensitive plates, with more prolonged exposures,
ever fresh myriads of stars will be brought within our
view.</p>

<p>You must remember that every one of these stars is
truly a sun, a lamp, as it were, which doubtless gives
light to other objects in its neighborhood as our sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
sheds light upon this earth and the other planets. In
fact, to realize the glories of the heavens you should
try to think that the brilliant points you see are merely
the luminous points of the otherwise invisible universe.</p>

<p>Standing one fine night on the deck of a Cunarder
we passed in open ocean another great Atlantic steamer.
The vessel was near enough for us to see not only the
light from the mast-head but also the little beams from
the several cabin ports; and we could see nothing of
the ship herself. Her very existence was only known
to us by the twinkle of these lights. Doubtless her
passengers could see, and did see, the similar lights
from our own vessel, and they probably drew the
correct inference that these lights indicated a great
ship.</p>

<p>Consider the multiplicity of beings and objects in
a ship: the captain and the crew, the passengers, the
cabins, the engines, the boats, the rigging, and the
stores. Think of all the varied interests there collected
and then reflect that out on the ocean, at night, the
sole indication of the existence of this elaborate structure
was given by the few beams of light that happened
to radiate from it. Now raise your eyes to the stars;
there are the twinkling lights. We cannot see what
those lights illuminate, we can only conjecture what
untold wealth of non-luminous bodies may also lie in
their vicinity; we may, however, feel certain that just as
the few gleaming lights from a ship are utterly inadequate
to give a notion of the nature and the contents
of an Atlantic steamer, so are the twinkling stars utterly
inadequate to give even the faintest conception of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
extent and the interest of the universe. We merely
see self-luminous bodies, but of the multitudes of objects
and the elaborate systems of which these bodies are only
the conspicuous points we see nothing and we know
very little. We are, however, entitled to infer from an
examination of our own star—the sun—and of the
beautiful system by which it is surrounded, that these
other suns may be also splendidly attended. This is
quite as reasonable a supposition as that a set of lights
seen at night on the Atlantic Ocean indicates the existence
of a fine ship.</p>

<h3>THE CLUSTERS OF STARS.</h3>

<p>On a clear night you can often see, stretching across
the sky, a track of faint light, which is known to astronomers
as the “Milky Way.” It extends below the horizon
and then round the earth to form a girdle about the
heavens. When we examine the Milky Way with a telescope
we find, to our amazement, that it consists of
myriads of stars, so small and so faint that we are not
able to distinguish them individually; we merely see
the glow produced from their collective rays. Remembering
that our sun is a star, and that the Milky Way
surrounds us, it would almost seem as if our sun were
but one of the host of stars which form this cluster.</p>

<div id="ifig_83" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 18em;">
  <img src="images/i_p328.jpg" width="279" height="288" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 83.</span>—Globular Cluster in the Centaur.</div></div>

<p>There are also other clusters of stars, some of which
are exquisitely beautiful telescopic spectacles. I may
mention a celebrated pair of these objects which lies in
the constellation of Perseus. The sight of them in a
great telescope is so imposing that no one who is fit to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
look through a telescope could resist a shout of wonder
and admiration when first they burst on his view. But
there are other clusters. Here is a picture of one
which is known as the “Globular Cluster in the Centaur”
(<a href="#ifig_83">Fig. 83</a>). It consists of a ball of stars, so far
off that, however large these several suns may actually
be, they have dwindled down to extremely small points
of light. A homely illustration may serve to show the
appearance which a globular cluster presents in a good
telescope. I take a pepper-castor and on a sheet of
white paper I begin to shake out the pepper until there
is a little heap at the centre and other grains are scattered
loosely about. Imagine that every one of those
grains of pepper was to be transformed into a tiny electric
light, and then you have some idea of what a cluster
of stars would look like when viewed through a telescope
of sufficient power. There are multitudes of such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
groups scattered through the depths of space. They
require our biggest telescopes to show them adequately.
We have seen that our sun is a star, being only one of
a magnificent cluster that form the Milky Way. We
have also seen that there are other groups scattered
through the length and depth of space. It is thus we
obtain a notion of the rank which our earth holds in
the scheme of things celestial.</p>

<h3>THE RANK OF THE EARTH AS A GLOBE IN SPACE.</h3>

<p>Let me give an illustration with the view of explaining
more fully the nature of the relation which the
earth bears to the other globes which abound through
space, and you must allow me to draw a little upon my
imagination. I shall suppose that Her Majesty’s mails
extend not only over this globe, but that they also communicate
with other worlds; that postal arrangements
exist between Mars and the earth, between the sun and
Orion—in fact, everywhere throughout the whole extent
of the universe. We shall consider how our letters
are to be addressed. Let us take the case of Mr. John
Smith, merchant, who lives at 1001, Piccadilly; and
let us suppose that Mr. John Smith’s business transactions
are of such an extensive nature that they reach
not only all over this globe, but away throughout space.
I shall suppose that the firm has a correspondent residing—let
us say in the constellation of the Great Bear;
and when this man of business wants to write to Mr.
Smith from these remote regions, what address must he
put upon the letter, so that the Postmaster-General of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
the universe shall make no mistake about its delivery?
He will write as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<p class="in0 in2">
<span class="smcap">Mr. John Smith,</span><br />
<span class="in2">1001 Piccadilly,</span><br />
<span class="in4">London,</span><br />
<span class="in6">England,</span><br />
<span class="in8">Europe,</span><br />
<span class="in10">Earth,</span><br />
<span class="in12">Near the Sun,</span><br />
<span class="in14">Milky Way,</span><br />
<span class="in16">The Universe.</span>
</p>

<p>Let us now see what the several lines of this address
mean. Of course we put down the name of Mr. John
Smith in the first line, and then we will add “1001
Piccadilly” for the second; but as the people in the
Great Bear are not likely to know where Piccadilly is,
we shall add “London” underneath. As even London
itself cannot be well known everywhere, it is better to
write “England.” This would surely find Mr. John
Smith from any post-office on this globe. From other
globes, however, the supreme importance of England
may not be so immediately recognized, and therefore it
is as well to add another line, “Europe.” This ought
to be sufficient, I think, for any post-office in the solar
system. Europe is big enough to be visible from Mars
or Venus, and should be known to the post-office people
there, just as we know and have names for the continents
on Mars. But further away there might be a
little difficulty; from Uranus and Neptune the different
regions on our earth can never have been distinguished,
and therefore we must add another line to indicate the
particular globe of the solar system which contains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
Europe. Mark Twain tells us that there was always
one thing in astronomy which specially puzzled him,
and that was to know how we found out the names of
the stars. We are, of course, in hopeless ignorance of
the name by which this earth is called among other
intelligent beings elsewhere who can see it. I can
only adopt the title of “Earth,” and therefore I add
this line. Now our address is so complete that from
anywhere in the solar system—from Mercury, from
Jupiter, or Neptune—there ought to be no mistake
about the letter finding its way to Mr. John Smith.
But from his correspondent in the Great Bear this
address would be still incomplete; they cannot see our
earth from there, and even the sun himself only looks
like a small star—like one, in fact, of thousands of stars
elsewhere. However, each star can be distinguished,
and our sun may, for instance, be recognized from the
Great Bear by some designation. We shall add the
line “Near the Sun,” and then I think that from this
constellation, or from any of the other stars around us,
the address of Mr. John Smith may be regarded as complete.
But Mr. Smith’s correspondence may be still
wider. He may have an agent living in the cluster of
Perseus or on some other objects still fainter and more
distant; then “Near the Sun” is utterly inadequate
as a concluding line to the address, for the sun, if it
can be seen at all from thence, will be only of the significance
of an excessively minute star, no more to be
designated by a special name than are each of the several
leaves on the trees of a forest. What this distant correspondent
will be acquainted with is not the earth or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
sun, but only the cluster of stars among which the sun
is but a unit. Again we use our own name to denote
the cluster, and we call it the “Milky Way.” When
we add this line, we have made the address of Mr. John
Smith as complete as circumstances will permit. I think
a letter posted to him anywhere ought to reach its destination.
To perfect it, however, we will finish up with
one line more—“<em>The Universe</em>.”</p>

<h3>THE DISTANCES OF THE STARS.</h3>

<p>I must now tell you something about the distances
of the stars. I shall not make the attempt to explain
fully how astronomers make such measurements, but I
will give you some notion of how it is done. You may
remember I showed you how we found the distance of
a globe that was hung from the ceiling. The principle
of the method for finding the distance of a star is somewhat
similar, except that we make the two observations
not from the two ends of a table, not even from opposite
sides of the earth, but from two opposite points on the
earth’s orbit, which are therefore at a distance of 186,000,000
miles. Imagine that on Midsummer Day, when
standing on the earth here, I measure with a piece of card
the angle between the star and the sun. Six months
later, on Midwinter Day, when the earth is at the opposite
point of its orbit, I again measure the angle between
the same star and the sun, and we can now determine
the star’s distance by making a triangle. I draw a line
a foot long, and we will take this foot to represent 186,000,000
miles, the distance between the two stations;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
then placing the cards at the corners, I rule the two
sides and complete the triangle, and the star must be
at the remaining corner; then I measure the sides of
the triangle, and find how many feet they contain, and
recollecting that each foot corresponds to 186,000,000
miles, we discover the distance of the star. If the
stars were comparatively near us, the process would be
a very simple one; but, unfortunately, the stars are so
extremely far off that this triangle, even with a base
of only one foot, must have its sides many miles long.
Indeed, astronomers will tell you that there is no more
delicate or troublesome work in the whole of their science
than that of discovering the distance of a star.</p>

<p>In all such measurements we take the distance from
the earth to the sun as a conveniently long measuring-rod,
whereby to express the results. The nearest stars
are still hundreds of thousands of times as far off as the
sun. Let us ponder for a little on the vastness of these
distances. We shall first express them in miles. Taking
the sun’s distance to be 93,000,000 miles, then the
distance of the nearest fixed star is about twenty millions
of millions of miles—that is to say, we express
this by putting down a 2 first, and then writing thirteen
ciphers after it. It is, no doubt, easy to speak of
such figures, but it is a very different matter when we
endeavor to imagine the awful magnitude which such a
number indicates. I must try to give some illustrations
which will enable you to form a notion of it. At first
I was going to ask you to try and count this number,
but when I found it would require at least 300,000
years, counting day and night without stopping, before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
the task was over, it became necessary to adopt some
other method.</p>

<p>When on a visit in Lancashire I was once kindly
permitted to visit a cotton mill, and I learned that the
cotton yarn there produced in a single day would be long
enough to wind round this earth twenty-seven times at
the equator. It appears that the total production of
cotton yarn each day in all the mills together would
be on the average about 155,000,000 miles. In fact,
if they would only spin about one-fifth more, we could
assert that Great Britain produced enough cotton yarn
every day to stretch from the earth to the sun and back
again! It is not hard to find from these figures how
long it would take for all the mills in Lancashire to
produce a piece of yarn long enough to reach from our
earth to the nearest of the stars. If the spinners worked
as hard as ever they could for a year, and if all the
pieces were then tied together, they would extend to
only a small fraction of the distance; nor if they worked
for ten years, or for twenty years, would the task be fully
accomplished. Indeed, upwards of 400 years would be
necessary before enough cotton could be grown in
America and spun in this country to stretch over a
distance so enormous. All the spinning that has ever
yet been done in the world has not formed a long enough
thread!</p>

<p>There is another way in which we can form some
notion of the immensity of these sidereal distances.
You will recollect that, when we were speaking of
Jupiter’s moons (<a href="#Page_219">p. 219</a>), I told you of the beautiful
discovery which their eclipses enabled astronomers to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
make. It was thus found that light travels at the enormous
speed of about 185,000 miles per second. It moves
so quickly that within a single second a ray would flash
two hundred times from London to Edinburgh and back
again.</p>

<p>We said that a meteor travels one hundred times as
swiftly as a rifle-bullet; but even this great speed seems
almost nothing when compared with the speed of light,
which is 10,000 times as great. Suppose some brilliant
outbreak of light were to take place in a distant star—an
outbreak which would be of such intensity that the
flash from it would extend far and wide throughout the
universe. The light would start forth on its voyage
with terrific speed. Any neighboring star which was at
a distance of less than 185,000 miles would, of course,
see the flash within a second after it had been produced.
More distant bodies would receive the intimation after
intervals of time proportional to their distances. Thus,
if a body were 1,000,000 miles away the light would
reach it in from five to six seconds, while over a distance
as great as that which separates the earth from the sun
the news would be carried in about eight minutes. We
can calculate how long a time must elapse ere the light
shall travel over a distance so great as that between the
star and our earth. You will find that from the nearest
of the stars the time required for the journey will
be over three years. Ponder on all that this involves.
That outbreak in the star might be great enough to be
visible here, but we could never become aware of it till
three years after it had happened. When we are looking
at such a star to-night we do not see it as it is at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
present, for the light that is at this moment entering
our eyes has travelled so far that it has been three years
on the way. Therefore, when we look at the star now
we see it as it was three years previously. In fact, if
the star were to go out altogether, we might still continue
to see it twinkling for a period of three years
longer, because a certain amount of light was on its way
to us at the moment of extinction, and so long as that
light keeps arriving here, so long shall we see the star
showing as brightly as ever. When, therefore, you look
at the thousands of stars in the sky to-night, there is
not one that you see as it is now, but as it was years
ago.</p>

<p>I have been speaking of the stars that are nearest to
us, but there are others much farther off. It is true
we cannot find the distance of these more remote
objects with any degree of accuracy, but we can convince
ourselves how great that distance is by the following
reasoning. Look at one of the brightest stars.
Try to conceive that the object was carried away
further into the depths of space, until it was ten times
as far from us as it is at present, it would still remain
bright enough to be recognized in quite a small telescope;
even if it were taken to one hundred times its
original distance it would not have withdrawn from the
view of a good telescope; while if it retreated one
thousand times as far as it was at first it would still
be a recognizable point in our mightiest instruments.
Among the stars which we can see with our telescopes,
we feel confident there must be many from which the
light has expended hundreds of years, or even thousands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
of years, on the journey. When, therefore, we look at
such objects, we see them, not as they are now, but as
they were ages ago; in fact, a star might have ceased
to exist for thousands of years, and still be seen by us
every night as a twinkling point in our great telescopes.</p>

<p>Remembering these facts, you will, I think, look at
the heavens with a new interest. There is a bright
star, Vega or Alpha Lyræ, a beautiful gem, so far off
that the light from it which now reaches our eyes
started before many of my audience were born. Suppose
that there are astronomers residing on worlds amid
the stars, and that they have sufficiently powerful
telescopes to view this globe, what do you think they
would observe? They will not see our earth as it is at
present, they will see it as it was years, and sometimes
many years, ago. There are stars from which, if
England could now be seen, the whole of the country
would be observed at this present moment to be in a
great state of excitement at a very auspicious event.
Distant astronomers might notice a great procession in
London, and they could watch the coronation of a
youthful queen amid the enthusiasm of a nation.
There are other stars still further, from which, if the
inhabitants had good enough telescopes, they would
now see a mighty battle in progress not far from
Brussels. One splendid army could be beheld hurling
itself time after time against the immovable ranks of
the other. They would not, indeed, be able to hear
the ever-memorable, “Up, Guards, and at them!” but
there can be no doubt that there are stars so far away
that the rays of light which started from the earth on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
the day of the battle of Waterloo are only just arriving
there. Further off still, there are stars from which a
bird’s-eye view could be taken at this very moment of
the signing of Magna Charta. There are even stars
from which England, if it could be seen at all, would
now appear, not as the great England we know, but as
a country covered by dense forests, and inhabited by
painted savages, who waged incessant war with wild
beasts that roamed through the island. The geological
problems that now puzzle us would be quickly solved
could we only go far enough into space and had we
only powerful enough telescopes. We should then be
able to view our earth through the successive epochs
of past geological time; we should be actually able to
see those great animals whose fossil remains are treasured
in our museums tramping about over the earth’s
surface, splashing across its swamps, or swimming with
broad flippers through its oceans. Indeed, if we could
view our own earth reflected from mirrors in the stars,
we might still see Moses crossing the Red Sea, or Adam
and Eve being expelled from Eden.</p>

<p>So important is the subject of star distance that I am
tempted to give one more illustration in order to bring
before you some conception of how vast such distances
are. I shall take, as before, the nearest of the stars so
far as known to us, and I hope to be forgiven for taking
an illustration of a practical and a commercial kind
instead of one more purely scientific. I shall suppose
that a railway is about to be made from London to
Alpha Centauri. The length of that railway, of course,
we have already stated: it is twenty billions of miles.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
So I am now going to ask your attention to the simple
question as to the fare which it would be reasonable to
charge for the journey. We shall choose a very cheap
scale on which to compute the price of a ticket. The
parliamentary rate here is, I believe, a penny for every
mile. We will make our interstellar railway fares
much less even than this; we shall arrange to travel at
the rate of one hundred miles for every penny. That,
surely, is moderate enough. If the charges were so
low that the journey from London to Edinburgh only
cost fourpence, then even the most unreasonable passenger
would be surely contented. On these terms how
much do you think the fare from London to this star
ought to be? I know of one way in which to make
our answer intelligible. There is a National Debt with
which your fathers are, unhappily, only too well acquainted;
you will know quite enough about it yourselves
in those days when you have to pay income tax.
This debt is so vast that the interest upon it is about
sixty thousand pounds a day, the whole amount of the
National Debt being six hundred and thirty-eight
millions of pounds (April, 1898).</p>

<p>If you went to the booking office with the whole of
this mighty sum in your pocket—but stop a moment;
could you carry it in your pocket? Certainly not, if
it were in sovereigns. You would find that after you
had as many sovereigns as you could conveniently carry
there would still be some left—so many, indeed, that
it would be necessary to get a cart to help you on with
the rest. When the cart had as great a load of sovereigns
as the horse could draw there would be still some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
more, and you would have to get another cart; but ten
carts, twenty carts, fifty carts, would not be enough.
You would want five thousand of these before you
would be able to move off towards the station with your
money. When you did get there and asked for a ticket
at the rate of one hundred miles for a penny, do you
think you would get any change? No doubt some
little time would be required to count the money, but
when it was counted the clerk would tell you that there
was not enough, that he must have nearly two hundred
millions of pounds more.</p>

<p>That will give some notion of the distance of the
nearest star, and we may multiply it by ten, by one
hundred, and even by one thousand, and still not attain
to the distance of some of the more remote stars that
the telescope shows us.</p>

<p>On account of the immense distances of the stars we
can only perceive them to be mere points of light. We
can never see a star to be a globe with marks on it like
the moon, or like one of the planets—in fact, the better
the telescope the smaller does the star seem, though,
of course, its brightness is increased with every addition
to the light-grasping power of the instrument.</p>

<h3>THE BRIGHTNESS AND COLOR OF STARS.</h3>

<p>Another point to be noticed is the arrangement of
stars in classes, according to their lustre. The brightest
stars, of which there are about twenty, are said to be
of the first magnitude. Those just inferior to the first
magnitude are ranked as the second; and those just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
lower than the second are estimated as the third; and
so on. The smallest points that your unaided eyes will
show you are of about the sixth magnitude. Then the
telescope will reveal stars still fainter and fainter, down
to what we term the seventeenth or eighteenth magnitudes,
or even lower still. The number of stars of each
magnitude increases very much in the classes of small
ones.</p>

<p>Most of the stars are white, but many are of a somewhat
ruddy hue. There are a few telescopic points
which are intensely red, some exhibit beautiful golden
tints, while others are blue or green.</p>

<p>There are some curious stars which regularly change
their brilliancy. Let me try to illustrate the nature of
these variables. Suppose that you were looking at a
street gas-lamp from a very long distance, so that it
seemed a little twinkling light; and suppose that some
one was preparing to turn the gas-cock up and down.
Or, better still, imagine a little machine which would
act regularly so as to keep the light first of all at its
full brightness for two days and a half, and then gradually
turn it down until in three or four hours it declines
to a feeble glimmer. In this low state the light remains
for twenty minutes; then during three or four hours
the gas is to be slowly turned on again until it is full.
In this condition the light will remain for two days and
a half, and then the same series of changes is to recommence.
This would be a very odd form of gas-lamp.
There would be periods of two days and a half during
which it would remain at its full; these would be separated
by intervals of about seven hours, when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
gradual turning down and turning up again would be in
progress.</p>

<div id="ifig_84" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img src="images/i_p343.jpg" width="418" height="478" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 84.</span>—Perseus and its Neighboring Stars, including Algol.</div></div>

<p>The imaginary gas-lamp is exactly paralleled by a
star Algol, in the constellation of Perseus (<a href="#ifig_84">Fig. 84</a>),
which goes through the series of changes I have
indicated. Ordinarily speaking, it is a bright star of
the second magnitude, and, whatever be the cause, the
star performs its variations with marvellous uniformity.
In fact, Algol has always arrested the attention of those
who observed the heavens, and in early times was
looked on as the eye of a Demon. There are many
other stars which also change their brilliancy. Most of
them require much longer periods than Algol, and
sometimes a new star which nobody has ever seen before
will suddenly kindle into brilliancy. It is now known
that the bright star Algol is attended by a dark companion.
This dark star sometimes comes between Algol
and the observer and cuts off the light. Thus it is that
the diminution of brightness is produced.</p>

<h3>DOUBLE STARS.</h3>

<p>Whenever you have a chance of looking at the
heavens through a telescope, you should ask to be shown
what is called <em>a double star</em>. There are many stars in
the heavens which present no remarkable appearance to
the unaided eye, but which a good telescope at once
shows to be of quite a complex nature. These are
what we call double stars, in which two quite distinct
stars are placed so close together that the unaided eye
is unable to separate them. Under the magnifying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
power of the telescope, however, they are seen to be
distinct. In order to give some notion of what these
objects are like, I shall briefly describe three of them.
The first lies in that best known of constellations, the
Great Bear. If you look at his tail, which consists of
three stars, you will see that near the middle one of the
three a small star is situated; we call this little star
Alcor, but it is the brighter one near Alcor to which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
specially call your attention. The sharpest eye would
never suspect that it was composed of two stars placed
close together. Even a small telescope will, however,
show this to be the case, and this is the easiest and the
first observation that a young astronomer should make
when beginning to turn a telescope to the heavens.
Of course, you will not imagine that I mean Alcor to be
the second component of the double star; it is the
bright star near Alcor which is the double. Here are
two marbles, and these marbles are fastened an inch
apart. You can see them, of course, to be separate;
but if the pair were moved further and further away,
then you would soon not be able to distinguish between
them, though the actual distance between the marbles
had not altered. Look at these two wax tapers which
are now lighted; the little flames are an inch apart.
You would have to view them from a station a third of
a mile away if the distance between the two flames
were to appear the same as that between the two components
of this double star. Your eye would never be
able to discriminate between two lights only an inch
apart at so great a distance; a telescope would, however,
enable you to do so, and this is the reason why
we have to use telescopes to show us double stars.</p>

<p>You might look at that double star year after year
throughout the course of a long life without finding
any appreciable change in the relative positions of its
components. But we know that there is no such thing
as rest in the universe; even if you could balance a
body so as to leave it for a moment at rest, it would
not stay there, for the simple reason that all the bodies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
round it in every direction are pulling at it, and it is
certain that the pull in one direction will preponderate,
so that move it must. Especially is this true in the
case of two suns like those forming a double star.
Placed comparatively near each other they could not
remain permanently in that position; they must gradually
draw together and come into collision with an awful
crash. There is only one way by which such a disaster
could be averted. That is by making one of these
stars revolve around the other just as the earth revolves
around the sun, or the moon revolves around the earth.
Some motion must, therefore, be going on in every genuine
double star, whether we have been able to see that
motion or not.</p>

<p>Let us now look at another double star of a different
kind. This time it is in the constellation of Gemini.
The heavenly twins are called Castor and Pollux. Of
these, Castor is a very beautiful double star, consisting of
two bright points, a great deal closer together than were
those in the Great Bear; consequently a better telescope
is required for the purpose of showing them separately.
Castor has been watched for many years, and it can be
seen that one of these stars is slowly revolving around
the other; but it takes a very long time, amounting to
hundreds of years, for a complete circuit to be accomplished.
This seems very astonishing, but when you
remember how exceedingly far Castor is, you will perceive
that that pair of stars which appear so close
together that it requires a telescope to show them
apart must indeed be separated by hundreds of millions
of miles. Let us try to conceive our own system<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
transformed into a double star. If we took our outermost
planet—Neptune—and enlarged him a good
deal, and then heated him sufficiently to make him
glow like a sun, he would still continue to revolve
round our sun at the same distance, and thus a double
star would be produced. An inhabitant of Castor who
turned his telescope towards us would be able to see
the sun as a star. He would not, of course, be able to
see the earth, but he might see Neptune like another
small star close to the sun. If generations of astronomers
in Castor continued their observations of our
system, they would find a binary star, of which one
component took a century and a half to go round the
other. Need we then be surprised that when we look
at Castor we observe movements that seem very slow?</p>

<p>There is often so much diffused light about the bright
stars seen in a telescope, and so much twinkling in
some states of the atmosphere, that stars appear to
dance about in rather a puzzling fashion, especially to
one who is not accustomed to astronomical observations.
I remember hearing how a gentleman once came to
visit an observatory. The astronomer showed him
Castor through a powerful telescope as a fine specimen
of a double star, and then, by way of improving his
little lesson, the astronomer mentioned that one of
these stars was revolving around the other. “Oh,
yes,” said the visitor, “I saw them going round and
round in the telescope.” He would, however, have
had to wait for a few centuries with his eye to the
instrument before he would have been entitled to make
this assertion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
Double stars also frequently delight us by giving
beautifully contrasted colors. I dare say you have
often noticed the red and the green lights that are
used on railways in the signal lamps. Imagine one of
those red and one of those green lights away far up in
the sky and placed close together, then you would have
some idea of the appearance that a colored double star
presents, though, perhaps, I should add that the hues
in the heavenly bodies are not so vividly different as
are those which our railway people find necessary.
There is a particularly beautiful double star of this
kind in the constellation of the Swan. You could
make an imitation of it by boring two holes, with a
red-hot needle, in a piece of card, and then covering
one of these holes with a small bit of the topaz-colored
gelatine with which Christmas crackers are made. The
other star is to be similarly colored with blue gelatine.
A slide made on this principle placed in the lantern
gives a very good representation of these two stars on
the screen. There are many other colored doubles
besides this one; and, indeed, it is noteworthy that we
hardly ever find a blue or a green star by itself in the
sky; it is always as a member of one of these pairs.</p>

<h3>HOW WE FIND WHAT THE STARS ARE MADE OF.</h3>

<p>Here is a piece of stone. If I wanted to know what
it was composed of, I should ask a chemist to tell me.
He would take it into his laboratory, and first crush it
into powder, and then, with his test tubes, and with
the liquids which his bottles contain, and his weighing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
scales, and other apparatus, he will tell all about it; there
is so much of this, and so much of that, and plenty of this,
and none at all of that. But now, suppose you ask this
chemist to tell you what the sun is made of, or one of
the stars. Of course, you have not a sample of it to
give him; how, then, can he possibly find out anything
about it? Well, he can tell you something, and this is
the wonderful discovery that I want to explain to you.
We now put down the gas, and I kindle a brilliant red
light. Perhaps some of those whom I see before me
have occasionally ventured on the somewhat dangerous
practice of making fireworks. If there is any boy here
who has ever constructed sky-rockets, and put the little
balls into the top which are to burn with such vivid
colors when the explosion takes place, he will know
that the substance which tinged that red fire must have
been <em>strontium</em>. He will recognize it by the color;
because <em>strontium</em> gives a red light which nothing else
will give. Here are some of these lightning papers, as
they are called; they are very pretty and very harmless;
and these, too, give brilliant red flashes as I throw
them. The red tint has, no doubt, been produced by
<em>strontium</em> also. You see we recognized the substance
simply by the color of the light it produced when
burning.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of you have tried to make a ghost at
Christmas by dressing up in a sheet, and bearing in
your hand a ladle blazing with a mixture of common
salt and spirits of wine, the effect produced being a
most ghastly one. Some mammas will hardly thank
me for this suggestion, unless I add that the ghost must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
walk about cautiously, for otherwise the blazing spirit
would be very apt to produce conflagrations of a kind
more extensive than those intended. However, by the
kindness of Professor Dewar, I am enabled to show the
phenomenon on a splendid scale, and also free from all
danger. I kindle a vivid flame of an intensely yellow
color, which I think the ladies will unanimously agree
is not at all becoming to their complexions, while the
pretty dresses have lost their variety of colors. Here
is a nice bouquet, and yet you can hardly distinguish
the green of the leaves from the brilliant colors of the
flowers, except by trifling differences of shade. Expose
to this light a number of pieces of variously colored
ribbon, pink and red and green and blue, and their
beauty is gone; and yet we are told that this yellow is
a perfectly pure color; in fact, the purest color that
can be produced. I think we have to be thankful that
the light which our good sun sends us does not possess
purity of that description. There is one substance
which will produce that yellow light; it is a curious
metal called sodium—a metal so soft that you can cut
it with a knife, and so light that it will float on water;
while, still more strange, it actually takes fire the moment
it is dropped on the water. It is only in a chemical
laboratory that you will be likely to meet with the
actual metallic sodium, yet in other forms the substance
is one of the most abundant in nature. Indeed, common
salt is nothing but sodium closely united with a
most poisonous gas, a few respirations of which would
kill you. But this strange metal and this noxious gas,
when united, become simply the salt for our eggs at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
breakfast. This pure yellow light, wherever it is seen,
either in the flame of spirits of wine mixed with salt or
in that great blaze at which we have been looking, is
characteristic of sodium. Wherever you see that particular
kind of light, you know that sodium must have
been present in the body from which it came.</p>

<p>We have accordingly learned to recognize two substances,
namely, <em>strontium</em> and <em>sodium</em>, by the different
lights which they give out when burning. To these
two metals we may add a third. Here is a strip of
white metallic ribbon. It is called magnesium. It
seems like a bit of tin at the first glance, but indeed it
is a very different substance from tin; for, look, when
I hold it in the spirit-lamp, the strip of metal immediately
takes fire, and burns with a white light so dazzling
that it pales the gas-flames to insignificance. There is
no other substance which will, when kindled, give that
particular kind of light which we see from magnesium.
I can recommend this little experiment as quite suitable
for trying at home; you can buy a bit of magnesium
ribbon for a trifle at the optician’s; it cannot explode
or do any harm, nor will you get into any trouble with
the authorities provided you hold it when burning over
a tray or a newspaper, so as to prevent the white ashes
from falling on the carpet.</p>

<p>There are, in nature, a number of simple bodies called
elements. Every one of these, when ignited under suitable
conditions, emits a light which belongs to it alone,
and by which it can be distinguished from every other
substance. I do not say that we can try the experiments
in the simple way I have here indicated. Many of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
materials will yield light which will require to be studied
by much more elaborate artifices than those which have
sufficed for us. But you see that the method affords a
means of finding out the actual substances present in
the sun or in the stars. There is a practical difficulty
in the fact that each of the heavenly bodies contains a
number of different elements; so that in the light it
sends us the hues arising from distinct substances are
blended into one beam. The first thing to be done is
to get some way of splitting up a beam of light, so as
to discover the components of which it is made. You
might have a skein of silks of different hues tangled
together, and this would be like the sunbeam as we
receive it in its unsorted condition. How shall we
untangle the light from the sun or a star? I will
show you by a simple experiment. Here is a beam
from the electric light; beautifully white and bright,
is it not? It looks so pure and simple, but yet that
beam is composed of all sorts of colors mingled together,
in such proportions as to form white light. I take a
wedge-shaped piece of glass called a prism, and when I
introduce it into the course of the beam, you see the
transformation that has taken place (<a href="#ifig_85">Fig. 85</a>). Instead
of the white light you have now all the colors of the
rainbow—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet,
marked by their initial letters in the figure. These
colors are very beautiful, but they are transient, for the
moment we take away the prism they all unite again to
form white light. You see what the prism has done;
it has bent all the light in passing through it; but it is
more effective in bending the blue than the red, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
consequently the blue is carried away much further
than the red. Such is the way in which we study the
composition of a heavenly body. We take a beam of
its light, we pass it through a prism, and immediately
it is separated into its components; then we compare
what we find with the lights given by the different
elements, and thus we are enabled to discover the substances
which exist in the distant object whose light we
have examined. I do not mean to say that the method
is a simple one; all I am endeavoring to show is a
general outline of the way in which we have discovered
the materials present in the stars. The instrument
that is employed for this purpose is called the spectroscope.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
And perhaps you may remember that name by
these lines, which I have heard from an astronomical
<span class="locked">friend:—</span></p>

<p>I am sure it will interest everybody to know that
the elements which the stars contain are not altogether
different from those of which the earth is made. It is
true there may be substances in the stars of which we
know nothing here; but it is certain that many of the
most common elements on the earth are present in
the most distant bodies. I shall only mention one,
the metal iron. That useful substance has been found
in some of the stars which lie at almost incalculable
distances from the earth.</p>

<h3>THE NEBULÆ.</h3>

<p>In drawing towards the close of these lectures I must
say a few words about some dim and mysterious objects
to which we have not yet alluded. They are what are
called nebulæ, or little clouds; and in one sense they
are justly called little, for each of them occupies but
a very small spot in the sky as compared with that
which would be filled by an ordinary cloud in our air.
The nebulæ are, however, objects of the most stupendous
proportions. Were our earth and thousands of
millions of bodies quite as big all put together, they
would not be nearly so great as one of these nebulæ.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
Astronomers reckon up the various nebulæ by thousands,
but I must add that most of them are apparently
faint and uninteresting. A nebula is sometimes liable
to be mistaken for a comet. The comet is, as I have
already explained, at once distinguished by the fact
that it is moving and changing its appearance from
hour to hour, while scores of years elapse without
changes in the aspect or position of a nebula. The
most powerful telescopes are employed in observing
these faint objects. I take this opportunity of showing
a picture of an instrument suitable for such observations.
It is the great reflector of the Paris Observatory
(<a href="#ifig_87">Fig. 87</a>).</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 86.</span>—The Ring Nebula in Lyra, under Different Telescopic
Powers.</div></div>

<p>There are such multitudes of nebulæ that I can only
show a few of the more remarkable kinds. In <a href="#ifig_86">Fig. 86</a>
will be seen pictures of a curious object in the constellation
of Lyra seen under different telescopic powers.
This is a gigantic ring of luminous gas. To judge of
the size of this ring let us suppose that a railway were
laid across it, and the train you entered at one side was
not to stop until it reached the other side, how long do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
you think this journey would require? I recollect some
time ago a picture in <cite>Punch</cite> which showed a train about
to start from London to Brighton, and the guard walking
up and down announcing to the passengers the
alarming fact that “this train stops nowhere.” An old
gentleman was seen vainly gesticulating out of the
window and imploring to be let out ere the frightful
journey was commenced. In the nebular railway the
passengers would almost require such a warning.</p>

<div id="ifig_87" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img src="images/i_p355.jpg" width="439" height="659" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 87.</span>—A Great Reflecting Telescope.</div></div>

<p>Let the train start at a speed of a mile a minute, you
would think, surely, that it must soon cross the ring.
But the minutes pass, an hour has elapsed; so the distance
must be sixty miles, at all events. The hours
creep on into days, the days advance into years, and
still the train goes on. The years would lengthen out
into centuries, and even when the train had been rushing
on for a thousand years with an unabated speed of
a mile a minute, the journey would certainly not have
been completed. Nor do I venture to say what ages
must elapse ere the terminus at the other side of the
ring nebula would be reached.</p>

<p>A cluster of stars viewed in a small telescope will
often seem like a nebula, for the rays of the stars
become blended. A powerful telescope will, however,
dispel the illusion and reveal the separate stars. It
was, therefore, thought that all the nebulæ might be
merely clusters so exceedingly remote that our mightiest
instruments failed to resolve them into stars. But
this is now known not to be the case. Many of these
objects are really masses of glowing gas; such are, for
instance, the ring nebulæ, of which I have just spoken,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
and the form of which I can simulate by a pretty
experiment.</p>

<div id="ifig_88" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 19em;">
  <img src="images/i_p357.jpg" width="296" height="223" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 88.</span>—How to make the Smoke-rings.</div></div>

<p>We take a large box with a round hole cut in one
face, and a canvas back at the opposite side. I first fill
this box with smoke, and there are different ways of
doing so. Burning brown paper does not answer well,
because the supply of smoke is too irregular and the
paper itself is apt to blaze. A little bit of phosphorus
set on fire yields copious smoke, but it would be apt to
make people cough, and, besides, phosphorus is a dangerous
thing to handle incautiously, and I do not want
to suggest anything which might be productive of disaster
if the experiment was repeated at home. A little
wisp of hay, slightly damped and lighted, will safely
yield a sufficient supply, and you need not have an
elaborate box like this; any kind of old packing-case,
or even a band-box with a duster stretched across its
open top and a round hole cut in the bottom, will
answer capitally. While I have been speaking, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
assistant has kindly filled this box with smoke, and in
order to have a sufficient supply, and one which shall
be as little disagreeable as possible, he has mixed together
the fumes of hydrochloric acid and ammonia
from two retorts shown in <a href="#ifig_88">Fig. 88</a>. A still simpler way
of doing the same thing is to put a little common salt
in a saucer and pour over it a little oil of vitriol; this
is put into the box, and over the floor of the box common
smelling-salts is to be scattered. You see there
are dense volumes of white smoke escaping from every
corner of the box. I uncover the opening and give a
push to the canvas, and you see a beautiful ring flying
across the room; another ring and another follow. If
you were near enough to feel the ring, you would experience
a little puff of wind; I can show this by blowing
out a candle which is at the other end of the table.
These rings are made by the air which goes into a sort
of eddy as it passes through the hole. All the smoke
does is to render the air visible. The smoke-ring is
indeed quite elastic. If we send a second ring hurriedly
after the first, we can produce a collision, and
you see each of the two rings remains unbroken, though
both are quivering from the effects of the blow. They
are beautifully shown along the beam of the electric
lamp, or, better still, along a sunbeam.</p>

<p>We can make many experiments with smoke-rings.
Here, for instance, I take an empty box, so far as smoke
is concerned, but air-rings can be driven forth from it,
though you cannot see them, but you can feel them
even at the other side of the room, and they will, as
you see, blow out a candle. I can also shoot invisible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
air-rings at a column of smoke, and when the missile
strikes the smoke it produces a little commotion and
emerges on the other side, carrying with it enough of
the smoke to render itself visible, while the solid black
looking ring of air is seen in the interior. Still more
striking is another way of producing these rings, for I
charge this box with ammonia, and the rings from it
you cannot see. There is a column of the vapor of
hydrochloric acid that also you cannot see; but when
the invisible ring enters the invisible column, then a
sudden union takes place between the vapor of the
ammonia and the vapor of the hydrochloric acid; the
result is a solid white substance in extremely fine dust
which renders the ring instantly visible.</p>

<h3>WHAT THE NEBULÆ ARE MADE OF.</h3>

<p>There is a fundamental difference between the illumination
of these little rings that I have shown you and
the great rings in the heavens. I had to illuminate our
smoke with the help of the electric light, for, unless I
had done so, you would not have been able to see them.
This white substance formed by the union of ammonia
and hydrochloric acid has, of course, no more light of
its own than a piece of chalk; it requires other light
falling upon it to make it visible. Were the ring nebula
in Lyra composed of this material, we could not see
it. The sunlight which illuminates the planets might,
of course, light up such an object as the ring, if it were
comparatively near us; but Lyra is at such a stupendous
distance that any light which the sun could send<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
out there would be just as feeble as the light we receive
from a fixed star. Should we be able to show our smoke-rings,
for instance, if, instead of having the electric light,
I merely cut a hole in the ceiling and allowed the feeble
twinkle of a star in the Great Bear to shine through?
In a similar way the sunbeams would be utterly powerless
to effect any illumination of objects in these stellar
distances. If the sun were to be extinguished altogether,
the calamity would no doubt be a very dire one so far
as we are concerned, but the effect on the other celestial
bodies (moon and planets excepted) would be of the
slightest possible description. All the stars of heaven
would continue to shine as before. Not a point in one
of the constellations would be altered, not a variation in
the brightness, not a change in the hue of any star could
be noticed. The thousands of nebulæ and clusters would
be absolutely unaltered; in fact, the total extinction of
the sun would be hardly remarked in the newspapers published
in the Pleiades or in Orion. There might possibly
be a little line somewhere in an odd corner to the effect
“Mr. So-and-So, our well-known astronomer, has noticed
that a tiny star, inconspicuous to the eye, and absolutely
of no importance whatever, has now become invisible.”</p>

<p>If, therefore, it be not the sun which lights up this
nebula, where else can be the source of its illumination?
There can be no other star in the neighborhood adequate
to the purpose, for, of course, such an object would be
brilliant to us if it were large enough and bright enough
to impart sufficient illumination to the nebula. It would
be absurd to say that you could see a man’s face by the
light of a candle while the candle itself was too faint or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
too distant to be visible. The actual facts are, of course,
the other way; the candle might be visible, when it was
impossible to discern the face which it lighted.</p>

<p>Hence we learn that the ring nebula must shine by
some light of its own, and now we have to consider
how it can be possible for such material to be self-luminous.
The light of a nebula does not seem to be
like flame; it can, perhaps, be better represented by
the pretty electrical experiment with Geissler’s tubes.
These are glass vessels of various shapes, and they are
all very nearly empty, as you will understand when I
tell you the way in which they have been prepared. A
little gas was allowed into each tube, and then almost
all the gas was taken out again, so that only a mere
trace was left. I pass a current of electricity through
these tubes, and now you see they are glowing with
beautiful colors. The different gases give out lights
of different hues, and the optician has exerted his skill
so as to make the effect as beautiful as possible. The
electricity, in passing through these tubes, heats the
gas which they contain, and makes it glow; and just
as this gas can, when heated sufficiently, give out
light, so does the great nebula, which is a mass of gas
poised in space, become visible in virtue of the heat
which it contains.</p>

<p>We are not left quite in doubt as to the constitution of
these gaseous nebulæ, for we can submit their light to
the prism in the way I explained when we were speaking
of the stars. Distant though that ring in Lyra may
be, it is interesting to learn that the ingredients from
which it is made are not entirely different from substances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
we know on our earth. The water in this glass,
and every drop of water, is formed by the union of two
gases, of which one is hydrogen. This is an extremely
light material, as you see by a little balloon which
ascends so prettily when filled with it. Hydrogen also
burns very readily, though the flame is almost invisible.
When I blow a jet of oxygen through the hydrogen, I
produce a little flame with a very intense heat. For
instance, I hold a steel pen in the flame, and it glows
and sputters, and falls down in white-hot drops. It is
needless to say that, as a constituent of water, hydrogen
is one of the most important elements on this earth. It
is, therefore, of interest to learn that hydrogen in some
form or other is a constituent of the most distant objects
in space that the telescope has revealed.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHING THE NEBULÆ.</h3>

<p>Of late years we have learned a great deal about
nebulæ, by the help which photography has given to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
us. Look at this group of stars which constitutes that
beautiful little configuration known as the Pleiades
(<a href="#ifig_89">Fig. 89</a>). It looks like a miniature representation of
the Great Bear; in fact, it would be far more appropriate
to call the Pleiades the Little Bear than to apply
that title to another quite different constellation, as has
unfortunately been done. The Pleiades form a group
containing six or seven stars visible to the ordinary eye,
though persons endowed with exceptionally good vision
can usually see a few more. In an opera-glass the
Pleiades becomes a beautiful spectacle, though in a large
telescope the stars appear too far apart to make a really
effective cluster. When Mr. Roberts took a photograph
of the Pleiades he placed a highly sensitive plate in his
telescope, and on that plate the Pleiades engraved their
picture with their own light. He left the plate exposed
for hours, and on developing it not only were the stars
seen, but there were also patches of faint light due to the
presence of nebula. It could not be said that the objects
on the plate were fallacious, for another photograph was
taken, when the same appearances were reproduced.</p>

<div id="ifig_89" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21em;">
  <img src="images/i_p362.jpg" width="335" height="223" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 89.</span>—The Pleiades.</div></div>

<p>When we look at that pretty group of stars which
has attracted admiration during all time, we are to
think that some of those stars are merely the bright
points in a vast nebula, invisible to our unaided eyes
or even to our mighty telescopes, though capable of
recording its trace on the photographic plate. Does not
this give us a greatly increased notion of the extent of
the universe, when we reflect that by photography we
are enabled to see much which the mightiest of telescopes
had previously failed to disclose?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
Of all the nebulæ, now numbering some thousands,
there is but a single one which can be seen without a
telescope. It is in the constellation of Andromeda, and
on a clear dark night can just be seen with the unaided
eye as a faint stain of light on the sky. It has happened
before now that persons noticing this nebula for
the first time have thought they had discovered a comet.
I would like you to try and find out this object for
yourselves.</p>

<p>If you look at it with an opera-glass it appears to be
distinctly elongated. You can see more of its structure
when you view it in larger instruments, but its nature
was never made clear until some beautiful photographs
were taken by Mr. Roberts (<a href="#ifig_90">Fig. 90</a>). Unfortunately,
the nebula in Andromeda has not been placed in the
best position for its portrait from our point of view. It
seems as if it were a rather flat-shaped object, turned
nearly edgewise towards us. To look at the pattern on
a plate, you would naturally hold the plate so as to be
able to look at it squarely. The pattern would not be
seen well if the plate were so tilted that its edge was
turned towards you. That seems to be nearly the way
in which we are forced to view the nebula in Andromeda.
We can trace in the photograph some divisions
extending entirely round the nebula, showing that it
seems to be formed of a series of rings; and there are
some outlying portions which form part of the same
system. Truly this is a marvellous object. It is
impossible for us to form any conception of the true
dimensions of this gigantic nebula; it is so far off that
we have never yet been able to determine its distance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
Indeed, I may take this opportunity of remarking that
no astronomer has yet succeeded in ascertaining the
distance of any nebula. Everything, however, points
to the conclusion that they are at least as far as the
stars.</p>

<div id="ifig_90" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_p365.jpg" width="394" height="493" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 90.</span>—The Great Nebula in Andromeda.</p>

<p>(<cite>From Mr. Roberts’ Photograph.</cite>)</p></div></div>

<p>It is almost impossible to apply the methods which
we use in finding the distance of a star to the discovery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
of the distance of the nebulæ. These flimsy bodies are
usually too ill-defined to admit of being measured with
the precision and the delicacy required for the determination
of distance. The measurements necessary for
this purpose can only be made from one star-like point
to another similar point. If we could choose a star in
the nebula and determine its distance, then, of course,
we should have the distance of the nebula itself; but
the difficulty is that we have, in general, no means of
knowing whether the star does actually lie in the object.
It may, for anything we can tell, lie billions of miles
nearer to us, or billions of miles further off, and, by
merely happening to lie in the line of sight, appear to
glimmer in the nebula itself.</p>

<div id="ifig_91" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 26em;">
  <img src="images/i_p367.jpg" width="408" height="261" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 91.</span>—To show how Small the Solar System is compared with
a Great Nebula.</div></div>

<p>If we have any assurance that the star is surrounded
by a mass of this glowing vapor, then it may be possible
to measure that nebula’s distance. It will occasionally
happen that grounds can be found for believing that a
star which appears to be in the glowing gas does veritably
lie therein, and is not merely seen in the same
direction. There are hundreds of stars visible on a
good drawing or a good photograph of the famous
object in Andromeda, and doubtless large numbers of
these are merely stars which happen to lie in the same
line of sight. The peculiar circumstances attending
the history of one star seem, however, to warrant us
in making the assumption that it was certainly in the
nebula. The history of this star is a remarkable one.
It suddenly kindled from invisibility into brilliancy.
How is a change so rapid in the lustre of a star to be
accounted for? In a few days its brightness had undergone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
an extraordinary increase. Of course, this does
not tell us for certain that the star lay in the glowing
gas; but the most rational explanation that I have
heard offered of this occurrence is that due, I believe,
to my friend Mr. Monck. He has suggested that the
sudden outbreak in brilliancy might be accounted for
on the same principles as those by which we explain the
ignition of meteors in our atmosphere. If a dark star,
moving along with terrific speed through space, were
suddenly to plunge into a dense region of the nebula,
heat and light must be evolved in sufficient abundance
to transform the star into a brilliant object. If, therefore,
we knew the distance of this star at the time it
was in Andromeda, we should, of course, learn the
distance of that interesting object. This has been
attempted, and it has thus been proved that the Great
Nebula must be very much further from us than is that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
star of whose distance I attempted some time ago to
give you a notion.</p>

<p>We thus realize the enormous size of the Great
Nebula. It appears that if, on a map of this object, we
were to lay down, accurately to scale, a map of the solar
system, putting the sun in the centre and all the planets
around in their true proportions out to the boundary
traced by Neptune, this area, vast though it is, would
be a mere speck on the drawing of the object. Our
system would have to be enormously bigger before it
sufficed to cover anything like the area of the sky
included in one of these great objects. Here is a sketch
of a nebula (<a href="#ifig_91">Fig. 91</a>), and near it I have marked a dot
which is to indicate our solar system. We may feel
confident that the Great Nebula is at the very least as
mighty as this proportion would indicate.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>And now, my young friends, I am drawing near the
close of that course of lectures which has occupied us,
I hope you will think not unprofitably, for a portion of
our Christmas holidays. We have spoken of the sun
and of the moon, of comets and of stars, and I have
frequently had occasion to allude to the relative position
of our earth in the universe. No doubt it is a noble
globe which we inhabit, but I have failed in my purpose
if I have not shown you how insignificant is this earth
when compared with the vast extent of some of the
other bodies that abound in space. We have, however,
been endowed with a feeling of curiosity which makes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
us long to know of things beyond the confines of our
own earth. Astronomers can tell us a little, but too
often only a little. They will say—That is a star, and
That is a planet, and That is so big, and That so far;
such is the meagre style of information with which we
often have to be content. The astronomers who live on
other worlds, if their faculties be in any degree comparable
with ours, must be similarly ignorant with
regard to this earth. Inhabitants of our fellow-planets
can know hardly anything more than that the earth on
which we dwell is a globe 8000 miles across, with
many clouds around us. Some of the planets would
not even pay us the compliment of recognizing our
existence; while from the other systems—the countless
other systems—of space we are absolutely imperceptible
and unknown.</p>

<p>Out of all the millions of bodies which we can see,
you could very nearly count on your fingers those from
which our earth would be visible. This reflection is
calculated to show us how vast must be the real extent
of that universe around us. Here is our globe, with its
inhabitants, with its great continents, with its oceans,
with its empires, its kingdoms, with its arts, its commerce,
its literature, its sciences, and yet it would seem
that all these things are absolutely unknown to any
inhabitants that may exist elsewhere. I do not think
that any reasonable person will doubt that there must
be inhabitants elsewhere. There are millions of globes,
many of them more splendid than ours. Surely it
would be presumptuous to say that this is the only
one of all the bodies in the universe on the surface of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
which life, with all that life involves, is manifested.
You will rather think that our globe is but one in the
mighty fabric, and that other globes may teem with
interest just as ours does. We can, of course, make
no conjecture as to what the nature of the life may be
elsewhere. Could a traveller visit some other globes
and bring back specimens of the natural objects that he
found there, no collections that the world has ever seen
could rival them in interest. When I go into the British
Natural History Museum and look around that
marvellous collection, it awakens in me a feeling of
solemnity. I see there the remains of mighty extinct
animals which once roamed over this earth; also objects
which have been dredged from the bottom of the sea at
a depth of some miles; there I can examine crystals
which have required incalculable ages for their formation;
and there I look at meteorites which have travelled
from the heavens above down on to the earth beneath.
Such sights, and the reflections they awaken, bring
before us in an imposing manner the phenomena of our
earth, and the extent and interest of its past history.
Oliver Wendell Holmes said that the only way to see
the British Museum was to take lodgings close by when
you were a boy, and to stay in the Museum from nine
to five every day until you were an old man; then you
would begin to have some notion of what this Institution
contains. Think what millions of British Museums
would be required were the universe to be adequately
illustrated: one museum for the earth, another for
Mars, another for Venus—but it would be useless
attempting to enumerate them!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
Most of us must be content with acquiring the
merest shred of information with regard even to our
own earth. Perhaps a schoolboy will think it fortunate
that we are so ignorant with respect to the celestial
bodies. What an awful vista of lessons to be learned
would open before his view, if only we had a competent
knowledge of the other globes which surround us in
space! I should like to illustrate the extent of the
universe by following this reflection a little further.
I shall just ask you to join with me in making a little
calculation as to the extent of the lessons you would
have to learn if astronomers should succeed in discovering
some of the things they want to know.</p>

<p>Of course, all of us learn geography and history.
We must know the geography of the leading countries
of the globe, and we must have some knowledge
of their inhabitants and of their government, their
resources and their civilization. It would seem shockingly
ignorant not to know something about China, or
not to have some ideas on the subject of India or Egypt.
The discovery of the New World also involves matters
on which every boy and girl has to be instructed. Supposing
we were so far acquainted with the other globes
scattered through space that we were able to gain some
adequate knowledge of their geography and natural history,
of the creatures that inhabit them, of their different
products and climates, then everybody would be
anxious to learn those particulars; and even when the
novelty had worn off, it would still be right for us to
know something about countries perhaps more populous
than China, about nations more opulent than our own,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
about battles mightier than Waterloo, about animals
and plants far stranger than any we have ever dreamt
of. An outline of all such matters should, of course,
be learned, and as the amount of information would be
rather extensive, we will try to condense it as much as
possible.</p>

<p>To aid us in realizing the full magnificence of that
scheme in the heavens of which we form a part, I shall
venture to give an illustration. Let us attempt to form
some slight conception of the number and of the bulk
of the books which would be necessary for conveying
an adequate description of that marvellous universe of
stars which surround us. These stars being suns, and
many of them being brighter and larger than our own
sun, it is but reasonable to presume that they may be
attended by planetary systems. I do not say that we
have any right to infer that such systems are like ours.
It is not improbable that many of the suns around us
have a much poorer retinue than that which dignifies
our sun. On the other hand, it is just as likely that
many of these other suns may be the centres of systems
far more brilliant and interesting, with far greater diversity
of structure, with far more intensity and variety
of life and intelligence than are found in the system of
which we form a part. It is only reasonable for us to
suppose that, as our earth is an average planet, so our
sun is an average star both in size and in the importance
of its attendants. We may take the number of
stars in the sky at about one hundred millions; and
thus we see that the books which are to contain a
description of the entire universe—or rather, I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
say, of the entire universe that we see—must describe
100,000,000 times as much as is contained in our single
system. Of course, we know next to nothing of what
the books should contain; but we can form some conjecture
of the number of those books, and this is the
notion to which I now ask your attention.</p>

<p>So vast is the field of knowledge that has to be traversed,
that we should be obliged to compress our descriptions
into the narrowest compass. We begin with
a description of our earth, for nearly all the books in
the libraries that exist at this moment are devoted to
subjects connected with this earth. They include various
branches of history, innumerable languages and literatures
and religions, everything relating to life on this
globe, to its history in past geological times, to its geography,
to its politics, to every variety of manufacture
and agriculture, and all the innumerable matters which
concern our earth’s inhabitants, past and present. But
this tremendous body of knowledge must be much condensed
before it would be small enough to retire to its
just position in the great celestial library. I can only
allow to the earth one volume of about 500 pages.
Everything that has to be said about our earth must be
packed within this compass. All terrestrial languages,
histories, and sciences that cannot be included between
its covers can find no other place on our shelves. I cannot
spare any more room. Our celestial library will be
big enough, as you shall presently see. I am claiming
a good deal for our earth when I regard it as one of the
most important bodies in the solar system. Of course
it is not the biggest—very far from it; but it seems as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
if the big planets and the sun were not likely to be
inhabited, so that if we allow one other volume to the
rest of the solar system, it will perhaps be sufficient,
though it must be admitted that Venus, of which we
know next to nothing, except that it is as large as the
earth, may also be quite as full of life and interest.
Mars and Mercury are also among the planets with
possible inhabitants. We are, therefore, restricting the
importance of the solar system as much as possible, perhaps
even too much, by allowing it two. Within those
two volumes every conceivable thing about the entire
solar system—sun, planets (great and small), moons,
comets, and meteors—must be included, or else it
would not be represented at all in the great celestial
library.</p>

<p>We shall deal on similar principles with the other
systems through space. Each of the 100,000,000 stars
will have two volumes allotted to it. Within the two
volumes devoted to each star we must compress our
description of the body itself and of the system which
surrounds it; the planets, their inhabitants, histories,
arts, sciences, and all other information. I am not,
remember, discussing the contents, but only the number
of books we should have to read ere we could obtain
even the merest outline of the true magnificence of the
heavens. Let us try to form some estimate as to the
kind of library that would be required to accommodate
200,000,000 volumes. I suppose a long straight hall,
so lofty that there could be fifty shelves of books on each
side. As you enter you look on the right hand and on
the left, and you see it packed from floor to ceiling with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
volumes. We have arranged them according to the
constellations. All the shelves in one part contain
the volumes relating to the worlds in the Great
Bear, while upon the other side may repose ranks
upon ranks of volumes relating to the constellation of
Orion.</p>

<p>I shall suppose that the volumes are each about an
inch and a half thick, and as there are fifty shelves on
each side, you will easily see that for each foot of its
length the hall will accommodate 800 books. We can
make a little calculation as to the length of this library,
which, as we walk down through it, stretches out before
us in a majestic corridor, with books, books everywhere.
Let us continue our stroll, and as we pass by we find
the shelves on both sides packed with their thousands
of volumes; and we walk on and on, and still see no
end to the vista that ever opens before us. In fact, no
building that was ever yet constructed would hold this
stupendous library. Let the hall begin on the furthest
outskirts of the west of London, carry it through the
heart of the city, and away to the utmost limits of the
east—not a half of the entire books could be accommodated.
The mighty corridor would have to be fifty
miles long, and to be packed from floor to ceiling with
fifty shelves of books on each side, if it is to contain
even this very inadequate description of the contents
of the visible universe. Imagine the solemn feelings
with which we should enter such a library, could it
be created by some miracle! As we took down one of
the volumes, with what mysterious awe should we open
it, and read therein of some vast world which eye had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
never seen! There we might learn strange problems
in philosophy, astonishing developments in natural history;
with what breathless interest we should read of
inhabitants of an organization utterly unknown to our
merely terrestrial experience! Notwithstanding the
vast size of the library, the description of each globe
would have to be very scanty. Thus, for instance, in
the single book which referred to the earth I suppose a
little chapter might be spared to an island called England,
and possibly a page or so to its capital, London.
Similarly meagre would have to be the accounts of the
other bodies in the universe; and yet, for this most
inadequate of abstracts, a library fifty miles long, and
lined closely with fifty shelves of books on each side,
would be required!</p>

<p>Methuselah lived, we are told, nine hundred and
sixty-nine years; but even if he had attained his
thousandth birthday he would have had to read about
300 of these books through every day of his life before
he accomplished the task of learning even the merest
outline about the contents of space.</p>

<p>If, indeed, we were to have a competent knowledge
of all these other globes, of all their countries, their
geographies, their nations, their climates, their plants,
their animals, their sciences, languages, arts and literatures,
it is not a volume, or a score of volumes, that
would be required, but thousands of books would have
to be devoted to the description of each world alone,
just as thousands of volumes have been devoted to the
affairs of this earth without exhausting the subjects of
interest it presents. Hundreds of thousands of libraries,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
each as large as the British Museum, would not
contain all that should be written, were we to have
anything like a detailed description of the universe
<em>which we see</em>. I specially emphasize the words just
written, and I do so because the grandest thought of
all, and that thought with which I conclude, brings
before us the overwhelming extent of the unseen universe.
Our telescopes can, no doubt, carry our vision
to an immeasurable distance into the depths of space.
But there are, doubtless, stars beyond the reach of our
mightiest telescopes. There are stars so remote that
they cannot record themselves on the most sensitive
of photographic plates.</p>

<p>On the blackboard I draw a little circle with a piece
of chalk. I think of our earth as the centre, and this
circle will mark for us the limit to which our greatest
telescopes can sound. Every star which we see, or
which the photographic plate sees, lies within this
circle; but, are there no stars outside? It is true
that we can never see them, but it is impossible to
believe that space is utterly void and empty where it
lies beyond the view of our telescopes. Are we to
say that inside this circle stars, worlds, nebulæ, and
clusters are crowded, and that outside there is nothing?
Everything teaches us that this is not so. We
occasionally gain accession to our power by adding
perhaps an inch to the diameter of our object-glass, or
by erecting a telescope in an improved situation on
a lofty mountain peak, or by procuring a photographic
plate of increased sensibility. It thus happens
that we are enabled to extend our vision a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
further and to make this circle a little larger, and
thus to add a little more to the known inside which
has been won from the unknown outside. Whenever
this is done we invariably find that the new region
thus conquered is also densely filled with stars, with
clusters, and with nebulæ; it is thus unreasonable to
doubt that the rest of space also contains untold
myriads of objects, even though they may never, by
any conceivable improvement in our instruments, be
brought within the range of our observation. Reflect
that this circle is comparatively small with respect to
the space outside. It occupied but a small spot on this
blackboard, the blackboard itself occupies only a small
part of the end of the theatre, while the end of the
theatre is an area very small compared with that of
London, of England, of the world, of the solar system,
of the actual distance of the stars. In a similar way
the region of space which is open to our inspection is
an inconceivably small portion of the entire extent of
space. The unknown outside is so much larger than
the known inside, it is impossible to express the proportion.
I write down unity in this corner and a
cipher after it to make ten, and six ciphers again to
make ten millions, and again, six ciphers more to make
ten billions; but I might write six more, ay, I might
cover the whole of this blackboard with ciphers, and
even then I should not have got a number big enough
to express how greatly the extent of the space we cannot
see exceeds that of the space we see. If, therefore,
we admit the fact, which no reasonable person can
doubt, that this outside, this unknown, this unreachable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
and, to us, invisible space does really contain worlds
and systems as does this small portion of space in
which we happen to be placed—then, indeed, we
shall begin truly to comprehend the majesty of the
universe. What figures are to express the myriads
of stars that should form a suitable population for a
space inconceivably greater than that which contains
100,000,000 stars? But our imagination will extend
still further. It brings before us these myriads of
unseen stars with their associated worlds, it leads us
to think that these worlds may be full to the brim
with interests as great as those which exist on our
world. When we remember that, for an adequate
description of the worlds which we can see, one hundred
thousand libraries, each greater than any library
on earth, would be utterly insufficient, what conception
are we to form when we now learn that even this would
only amount to a description of an inconceivably small
fragment of the entire universe?</p>

<p>Let us conceive that omniscience granted to us an
adequate revelation of the ample glories of the heavens,
both in that universe which we do see and in that infinitely
greater universe which we do not see. Let a full
inventory be made of all those innumerable worlds, with
descriptions of their features and accounts of their inhabitants
and their civilizations, their geology and their
natural history, and all the boundless points of interest
of every kind which a world in the sense in which
we understand it does most naturally possess. Let
those things be written every one, then may we say
that were this whole earth of ours covered with vast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
buildings, lined from floor to ceiling with book-shelves—were
every one of these shelves stored full with
volumes, yet, even then this library would be inadequate
to receive the books that would be necessary
to contain a description of the glories of the sidereal
heavens.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CONCLUDING_CHAPTER">CONCLUDING CHAPTER.<br />

<span class="subhead">HOW TO NAME THE STARS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">Every</span> one who wishes to learn something about
astronomy should make a determined effort to become
acquainted with the principal constellations, and to
find out the names of the brighter and more interesting
stars. I have therefore added to <span class="smcap">Star-land</span> this
little chapter, in which I have tried to make the study
of the stars so simple that, by taking advantage of a
few clear nights, there ought to be no difficulty in
obtaining a knowledge of a few constellations.</p>

<p>The first step is to become familiar with the Great
Bear, or Ursa Major, as astronomers more generally
call the group. We begin with this, because after it
has been once recognized, then you will find it quite
easy to make out the other constellations and stars.
It may save you some trouble if you can get some one
to point out to you the Great Bear; but even without
such aid, I think you will be able to make out the
seven bright stars which form this remarkable group,
from the figure here given (<a href="#ifig_92">Fig. 92</a>). Of course, the
position of this constellation, as of every other in the
heavens, changes with the hour of the night, and
changes with the seasons of the year. About April the
constellation at 11 o’clock at night is high over your
head. In September at the same hour, the Great Bear
is low down in the north. It is to be seen in the west<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
in July, and at Christmas it lies in the east at convenient
hours in the evening for observation. One of the
advantages of using the Great Bear as the foundation
of our study of the stars arises from the fact that to an
observer in the British Islands or in similar latitudes
this group never sets. Whenever the sky is clear after
nightfall, the Great Bear is to be seen somewhere,
while the brightness of its component stars makes it a
conspicuous object. Indeed, there is only one constellation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
in the sky, namely, that of Orion, which is a
more brilliant group than the Great Bear. We shall
tell you about Orion presently, but it does not suit to
begin with, because it can only be seen in winter, and
is then placed very low down in the heavens.</p>

<div id="ifig_92" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23em;">
  <img src="images/i_p382.jpg" width="359" height="456" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 92.</span>—The Great Bear and the Pole Star.</div></div>

<p>Your next lesson will be to utilize the Great Bear
for the purpose of pointing out the Pole Star. Look
at the two stars marked α and β. They are called the
“Pointers,” because if you follow the direction they
indicate along the dotted line in the figure, they will
conduct your glance to the Pole. This is the most
important star in the heavens to astronomers, because
it happens to mark very nearly the position of the Pole
on the sky. You will easily note the peculiarity of
the Pole Star if you will look at it two or three times
in the course of the night. It will appear to remain in
the same place in the sky, while the other stars change
their places from hour to hour. It is very fortunate
that we have a star like this in the northern heavens;
the astronomers in Australia or New Zealand can see
no bright star lying near the Southern Pole which will
answer the purposes that the Pole Star does so conveniently
for us in the north.</p>

<p>The Pole Star belongs to a constellation which we
call the Little Bear; two other conspicuous members
of this group are the two “Guards”; you will see how
they are situated from <a href="#ifig_82">Fig. 82</a>, <a href="#Page_322">p. 322</a>. They lie
nearly midway between the Pole Star and the last of
the three stars which form the Great Bear’s Tail. The
same figure will also introduce us to another beautiful
constellation, namely, Cassiopeia. You will never find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
any difficulty in identifying the figure that marks this
group if you will notice that the Pole lies midway
between it and the Great Bear.</p>

<div id="ifig_93" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 32em;">
  <img src="images/i_p384.jpg" width="506" height="307" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 93.</span>—The Great Square of Pegasus.</div></div>

<p>Cassiopeia is also one of the constellations that never
set to British observers; but now we have to speak of
groups which do set, and which, therefore, can only be
observed when the proper season comes round. The
first of these is “the Great Square of Pegasus”; you
cannot see this group conveniently in the spring or
summer, but during the autumn and winter it is well
placed after nightfall. There are four conspicuous stars
forming the corners of the square, and then three others
marked α, γ, and β (<a href="#ifig_93">Fig. 93</a>), which form a sort of handle
to the square. In fact, if you once recognize this group,
you will perhaps see in it a resemblance to a great
saucepan with a somewhat bent handle, and then you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
will be acquainted with a large tract of Star-land near
the Square of Pegasus. From the figure you will see
that a line imagined to be drawn from the Pole Star
over the end of Cassiopeia, and then produced as far
again, will just lead to the Great Square. I have also
marked on this figure two objects that are of great telescopic
interest; one of them is the Nebula in Andromeda,
of which we had an account in the last lecture. You
see it lies halfway between the corner α of the square
and the group of Cassiopeia. Another interesting object
is the star marked γ Andromedæ. The telescope shows
it to consist of a pair of stars, the colors of which are
beautifully contrasted.</p>

<p>At the end of this handle to the Great Square of
Pegasus is the star α, in the constellation of Perseus.
It lies between two other stars γ and δ. We refer to
<a href="#ifig_84">Fig. 84</a>, in which these stars are shown. We there
employed the figure to indicate the position of Algol,
the remarkable variable star. Your map will also
point out some other important stellar features. If
we curve round the three marked γ, α, and δ of
Perseus, the eye is conducted to Capella, a gem of the
first magnitude in the constellation of Auriga. Close
to Capella is a long triangle, the corners of which are
the “Hœdi,” the three kids—which Capella is supposed
to nurture.</p>

<p>If we carry a curve through γ, α, δ, of Perseus, and
now bend it in the opposite way, the eye is led through
ε and ζ in the same constellation, and then on to the
Pleiades, of which we have already spoken.</p>

<div id="ifig_94" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img src="images/i_p386.jpg" width="467" height="722" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 94.</span>—Orion and Sirius.</div></div>

<p>Perseus lies in one of the richest parts of the heavens.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
The Milky Way stretches across the group, and the sky
is strewn with stars beyond number. Even an opera-glass
directed to this teeming constellation cannot fail
to afford the observer a delightful glimpse of celestial
scenery.</p>

<p>We may, however, specially remind the beginner that
the objects on this map are not always to be seen, and
as an illustration of the way in which the situation and
the visibility of the constellations are affected by the
time of year, I shall take the case of the Pleiades and
follow them through a season. Let us suppose that we
make a search for this group at 11 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> every night.
On the 1st of January, the Pleiades will be found high
up in the sky in the southwest. On the 1st of March,
they will be setting in the west at the same hour. On
the 1st of May, the Pleiades are not visible, neither
are they on the 1st of July. On the 1st of September,
they will be seen low down in the east. On the 1st
of November, they will be high in the heavens in the
southeast. On the ensuing 1st of January, the Pleiades
will be found back in the same place which they occupied
on the same date in the preceding year, and so
on throughout the cycle. Of course, you will not suppose
that their changes are due to actual motions
in the group of stars themselves. They are merely
apparent, and are to be explained by the motion of
the earth round its axis, and the revolution around
the sun.</p>

<p>Next we are to become acquainted with the glory
of our winter skies, the constellation of Orion, <a href="#ifig_94">Fig. 94</a>.
I dare say many of my readers are already familiar with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
the well-known twin stars which form the belt of Orion,
but if not, they will be able to recognize it by the help
of the groups already learned. Imagine a line drawn
from the Pole Star through Capella, and then produced
as much further again, and we shall be conducted into
the precincts of Orion. This group lies on the equator,
and, consequently, it is equally familiar to southern
astronomers and to those of the north. It can be best
seen by those who observe it from or near the equator.</p>

<p>The brightest star in Orion is known either as α
Orionis or as Betelgeuze, by which name it is represented
in the figure. This star is of the first magnitude,
and so is Rigel on the opposite side of the belt.
The three stars of the belt and the two others, γ and
κ, at which they point above and below, are of second
magnitude.</p>

<p>The owner of a telescope finds especial attractions in
this constellation. Notably among the subjects which
will interest him is the Great Nebula, the position of
which is indicated in our figure. Under the middle
of the belt are a few stars, around which is a hazy
light that is perceptible with the smallest telescopic
aid. Viewed by instruments of adequate proportions,
these have developed into a marvellous nebula of glowing
gas, attaining to dimensions so vast that no one has
yet ever attempted to estimate them.</p>

<p>The vicinity of Orion is also enriched with some of
the most interesting stellar objects. Follow the line of
the belt upwards to the right, and your eye is conducted
to a ruddy first magnitude star named Aldebaran, in
the constellation of the Bull. This is a pleasing object,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
which the beginner will sometimes be apt to confuse
with the planet Mars, to which, under certain circumstances,
it certainly bears a resemblance. Another very
pleasing little group, known as the Hyades, will be found
near Aldebaran. If the line of the belt of Orion be carried
down to the left, it will be found to point to Sirius,
or the Dog Star.</p>

<p>You will find it an interesting occupation to make
for yourself maps of small parts of the heavens. First
copy out the chief stars in their proper places from the
star atlas, and then fill in the smaller stars with your
own observations. Try first on some limited region of
the heavens; take the figure of Cassiopeia, for instance,
or the Square of Pegasus, and see if you can produce a
fair representation of those groups by marking in the
stars that your instrument will show you; or take the
Pleiades and make a tracing of the principal stars of
the group from the sketch that we have given (<a href="#ifig_89">Fig. 89</a>),
then take an opera-glass and fill in as carefully as you
can all that it will show. I can assure you that you
will find a little definite work of this kind full of
interest and instruction.</p>

<p>But I hope you will desire to advance further in the
study of the heavens. It is to be remembered that with
even the most moderate instruments there is much to
be done. Many comets have been detected, and many
planets have been discovered, by the use of telescopes
so small that they could be easily carried out from the
house for the evening’s work and brought back again
after the observations were over.</p>

<p>It remains for me to add a few words which will help<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
you in finding the planets. It is, of course, impossible
to represent such objects as Jupiter, Saturn, Venus,
Mars, and Mercury on maps of the heavens, because
these bodies are constantly moving about, and if their
places were right to-day they would be wrong to-morrow.
The almanac will be necessary for you here. You
must find out by its help what planets are visible and
in what part of the sky they are placed. Then you will
have to compare your maps with the heavens, and when
you find a bright star-like body that is not shown on
your maps you may conclude at once that it is the
planet. Although these objects are so star-like to the
unaided eye, yet the resemblance is at once dispelled
when we use a telescope. The star is only a bright
point of light and white, the planet shows a visible
shape. This is, at least, the case with the five planets
I have named; for there are others, such as Uranus and
Neptune, which are too far to be much more than star-like
points in ordinary telescopes. The minor planets
would not interest you.</p>

<p>I hope that the reading of <span class="smcap">Star-land</span> will, at all
events, induce you to make a beginning of the study
of the heavens, if you have not already done so. If
you have the advantage of a telescope, so much the
better; but, if this is impossible, make the best use of
your own eyes. Do not put it off or wait till you get
some one to teach you. If it be clear this very night,
go out and find the Great Bear and the Pole Star, and
as many of the other constellations as you can, and at
once commence your career as an astronomer.</p>
